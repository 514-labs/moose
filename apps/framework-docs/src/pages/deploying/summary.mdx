# Deploying Moose into Production
<LanguageSwitcher />

Once you've finished developing your Moose application locally, the next step is to deploy your Moose app into production. Check out the Architecture page to see what the architecture of your Moose application in production will look like.

Moose makes it easy to package and deploy your applications, whether you're deploying to a server with or without internet access. The deployment process is designed to be flexible and can accommodate both containerized and non-containerized environments.

## Key Deployment Steps

There are three main aspects to deploying a Moose application:

<TypeScript>
1. Setting up your build environment with Node.js and the Moose CLI
2. Building your application using `moose build`
3. Setting up your deployment environment with the necessary runtime dependencies (Node.js, Docker) and configuration
</TypeScript>

<Python>
1. Setting up your build environment with Python and the Moose CLI
2. Building your application using `moose build`
3. Setting up your deployment environment with the necessary runtime dependencies (Python, Docker) and configuration
</Python>

## Deployment Options

Moose supports several deployment scenarios:

1. **Standard Server Deployment**: Deploy your application to a server with internet access
2. **Offline Server Deployment**: Deploy to an environment without internet access
3. **Containerized Deployment**: Package your application in Docker containers for cloud or on-premises deployment

## Environment Configuration

For any deployment type, you'll need to configure:

1. Runtime environment variables
2. Database and storage cluster access
3. Network settings and security configurations
4. Application-specific configurations

The following pages provide detailed guides for each deployment scenario, including step-by-step instructions for both Python and TypeScript applications.
