# Quickstart: Analytics on your clickhouse database

This will walk you through using Aurora CLI to connect Aurora MCP tools to your Clickhouse database, allowing you to chat with your data in your client of choice. We'll use the Clickhouse Playground as our example database, but you can use any Clickhouse database.

<Callout type="info" title="Prerequisites">
- **OS**: macOS or Linux (WSL supported for Windows)
- **Docker Desktop/Engine**: [24.0.0+](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)
- **Node**: [version 20+](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (LTS recommended)
- **Client**: [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) or [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) or [Windsurf](https://windsurf.ai/download). For this particular use-case, we recommend Claude Desktop.
</Callout>

<Steps>
## Install Aurora CLI

```bash -i <(curl -fsSL https://fiveonefour.com/install.sh) moose,aurora```

## Configure your Aurora MCP

```
aurora connect clickhouse --connection-string "clickhouse://explorer:@play.clickhouse.com:443/default" --mcp cursor-project
```

This will configure the [Clickhouse MCP tools](https://docs.fiveonefour.com/aurora/tool-reference#remote-clickhouse) to read data from Clickhouse's Playground, but you can point this at any Clickhouse database. It sets up the MCP in Claude Desktop, but you can change this with the `--mcp` flag.

## Chat

Open your Claude Desktop client. 

You can check that the MCP is correctly configured by looking at `claude > settings > developer > aurora`. It should say "running".

You can can also look at `search and tools` beneath the chat window, you should see `aurora` in the list of MCPsâ€”if you click into it, you should see the tools that are enabled.

We recommend starting the chat with a context setting question like "tell me about the data I have available to me in Clickhouse".

# Quickstart: New Moose project from your clickhouse database

This will walk you through creating a new local Moose project reflecting the structure of your Clickhouse database. It will allow you to add data to your local dev environment from your remote Clickhouse database, and use Aurora MCP tools to enrich your project with metadata, or create new Moose primitives that you can use in your project (e.g.egress APIs). We'll use the Clickhouse Playground as our example database, but you can use any Clickhouse database.

# Quickstart: New Moose project from template
*ADS-B (aircraft transponder) data for getting started*

This will get you started with a Moose data engineering project ingesting Aircraft Transponder data that you can use to learn about Aurora's Analytics Engineering MCP toolset.

Requirements:

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) or [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/)

### Install

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
bash -i <(curl -fsSL https://fiveonefour.com/install.sh) aurora,moose
```

This will install [Moose](/moose) (our open source developer framework for Data Engineering) and [Aurora](https://aurora.fiveonefour.com).

This prompt you for an Anthropic token, if you don't have one, see: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/initial-setup

### Creating your Project

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
aurora init <project-name> ads-b
```

This will create a new Moose project using the ADS-B template to gather ADS-B (aircraft transponder) data that you can use to explore Aurora's MCP offerings. By default, it will create the project configured for use with Cursor (by creating `~/.cursor/mcp.config`), but if you would like to use Claude Desktop, append `--mcp claude-desktop`.

If you want to create an empty project, and build your own Data Models and ingestion, try `aurora init <project-name> typescript-empty` or `aurora init <project-name> python-empty`

### Installing Dependencies

Navigate into the created project directory: 

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
cd <project-name>
```

Install the dependencies: 

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
npm i
```

### Open Cursor and Enable the MCPs

Then open your code editor `cursor .`

Cursor should prompt you to enable the MCP. If it doesn't, go to `cursor > settings > cursor settings > MCP` and enable the MCP called "aurora". Note, the tools will not all work until the dev server is run locally! Note, you might need to refresh the MCP until its status indicator shows ðŸŸ¢.

### Run the Moose Dev Server Locally

**Warning: make sure you have docker desktop running before this step!**

You now have the project ready to go, run `moose dev` to start the dev server.

### Start Ingesting Data

Run the command to start ingesting data with the configured ingest scripts: `moose workflow run military_aircraft_tracking`

You should start to see hundreds of live datapoints ingesting instantly!

### Start Using Aurora

In the LLM discussion pane, ask your host about your Moose project, it should use Aurora MCP tools to deliver rich context!
