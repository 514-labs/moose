## Create an Empty Moose Project

#### Install the Moose CLI

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
npx create-moose-app@latest moose-github-analytics typescript
```

This Moose CLI helper function creates a new Moose app with the proper conventions for the basic directory structure. This includes an /app folder which contains the heart of your new Moose app. Each sub-folder containing one type of Moose primitive.

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder open title="moose-github-analytics">
    <FileTree.Folder open title="app">
      <FileTree.Folder title="datamodels" />
      <FileTree.Folder title="functions" />
      <FileTree.Folder title="blocks" />
      <FileTree.Folder title="apis" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

#### `cd` into your Moose Project and Install Dependencies

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
cd moose-github-analytics && npm install
```

#### Run the Moose Development Server

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
moose-cli dev
```

<Callout type="warning">

<ZoomImg src="/moose-dev-terminal.png" />

{" "}

<Callout type="success">
  You have set up a Moose instance at `http://localhost:4000`. <br /> <br />{" "}
  This development server provides the following infrastructure:
  <ul>
    - **OLAP Database** (Clickhouse) to store and analyze your data -
    **Streaming Data Platform** (Redpanda) to buffer and transform incoming data
    - **Ingestion and Consumption APIs** to get data in and out of your database
  </ul>
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  The development server will automatically hot-swap in the latest code as you
  make changes, so you can see your entire Moose application running locally as
  you develop.
