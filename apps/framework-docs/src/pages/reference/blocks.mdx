        ## Initialize Your Aggregation
        Run the following command in your CLI to get started with a new aggregation in your Moose project:

        ```bash copy
        moose aggregation init <aggregation_name>
        ```

        Replace `<aggregation_name>` with your desired name. This name will be used both as the filename of the aggregation and the table name of the aggregated data.

        ## Develop Your Aggregation Logic

        Define your query in the `<aggregation_name>.ts` file. This file must export an object with two properties:

        - `select`: A valid Clickhouse SQL `SELECT` query that aggregates data
        - `orderBy`: Columns that define the primary key for the target table where your query results will be stored. To define multiple columns, put them in parentheses e.g. `orderBy: “(column1, column2)”`

        ## Using Your Aggregation

        When you save the aggregation file, Moose automatically creates a new table named after your file and populates it with the results of the `SELECT` statement.

        ## Example Aggregation
        The default Moose project comes with an example aggregation, it calculates the number of unique users who complete a sign-in activity each day:

        ```ts filename="aggregations/DailyActiveUsers.ts" copy
        import { Aggregation } from "@514labs/moose-lib";

        export default {
          select: `
            SELECT
                count(distinct userId) as dailyActiveUsers,
                toStartOfDay(timestamp) as date
            FROM ParsedActivity_0_0
            WHERE activity = 'Login'
            GROUP BY toStartOfDay(timestamp)
            `,
          orderBy: "date",
        } as Aggregation;
        ```
