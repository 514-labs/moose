## Windsurf

<Steps>

### Install 
[Install Windsurf here](https://windsurf.com/).

### Configure Aurora MCP

From an existing Moose project: 
```
aurora setup --mcp windsurf-global
```

From an existing Clickhouse project (chat only): 
```
aurora connect clickhouse --connection-string "https://explorer:@play.clickhouse.com:443/?database=default" --mcp windsurf-global
```

Create a new project with Claude Desktop MCP preconfigured: 
```
aurora init <project-name> <template-name> --mcp windsurf-global
```

Using MCP.JSON

```json filename="/path/to/your/project/.cursor/mcp.json" copy
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aurora": {
      "args": [
        "@514labs/aurora-mcp@latest",
        "--moose-read-tools",
        "path/to/your/moose/project"
      ],
      "command": "npx",
      "env": {
        "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": "<your-anthropic-api-key>",
        "MOOSE_PATH": "path/to/your/moose/installation",
        "NODE_PATH": "path/to/your/node/installation",
        "PYTHON_PATH": "path/to/your/python/installation"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Adding other toolsets

All toolsets are available to Cursor MCPs. See [tools reference](../aurora/reference/tool-reference) for more information.

### Using the MCP

1. Open Windsurf
2. Run the MCP by going to `windsurf > settings > windsurf settings > cascade > Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers` and enable the MCP there.
3. If you are using Moose tools, you will need to run your moose dev server with `moose dev`.

</Steps>

### Warnings / Peculiarities

* Every time you add an MCP or change its configuration, you will need to reload the MCP. You can do this by going to `windsurf > settings > windsurf settings > cascade > Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers` and toggling the MCP off and on or refreshing the server. If this doesn't work, you can also restart the Windsurf application.
* If you have configured the MCP globally, and want to change the Moose Project that the Aurora MCP is referring to, manually edit the MCP.JSON file or run `aurora config focus` and select a new project.

### Common issues / troubleshooting

* The MCP is running, but you aren't able to get your data? Look at the tool call response, it will tell you if your Moose dev server is running. If it is not, run `moose dev` in your Moose project directory.
* The MCP is not running. Check your configuration and then restart the application.
