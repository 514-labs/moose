## 2025-08-20

<ReleaseHighlights>
  - **Improved IngestPipeline API Clarity** — The `ingest` parameter has been renamed to `ingestApi` (TypeScript) and `ingest_api` (Python) for better clarity. The old parameter names are still supported with deprecation warnings.
</ReleaseHighlights>

<Changed>
  - **IngestPipeline Parameter Renamed** — The `ingest` parameter in IngestPipeline configurations has been renamed for clarity:
    - **TypeScript**: `ingest: true` → `ingestApi: true`
    - **Python**: `ingest=True` → `ingest_api=True`
    
    The old parameter names continue to work with deprecation warnings to ensure backwards compatibility. *[Current PR]*
</Changed>

<Deprecated>
  - **IngestPipeline `ingest` parameter** — The `ingest` parameter in IngestPipeline configurations is deprecated:
    - **TypeScript**: Use `ingestApi` instead of `ingest`
    - **Python**: Use `ingest_api` instead of `ingest`
    
    The old parameter will be removed in a future major version. Please update your code to use the new parameter names. *[Current PR]*
</Deprecated>

<BreakingChanges>
  None - Full backwards compatibility maintained

</ReleaseHighlights>

<Added>
