## What is Sloan?

Sloan is a set of tools to make your chat, copilot or BI fluent in data engineering. Use the CLI to set up MCPs with the tools you need in the clients you use. Create new data engineering projects with a moose-managed ClickHouse based infrastructure or use these agents with your existing data infrastructure.

## Why Sloan exists

<BulletPointsCard
  title="LLMs don't have the tools or context they need to be good data engineers, or to make good data engineering cyborgs."
  bullets={[
    {
      title: "LLM tools are hard to set up, and usually small in scope",
      description: "It takes me minutes to set up an MCP server, and I have to hold my breath every time I want to use it.",
    },
    {
      title: "Shallow context makes bad data",
      description: "If I'm just looking at the data, if I'm just looking at the code, if I'm just looking at the logs, if i'm just looking at the docs, I'm not going to make good decisions. I need all that context.",

      title: "I don't want to start from scratch to use AI",
      description: "I've already got an entire data infrastructure, why should I start from scratch to use AI?",
    },
    {
      title: "Brittle data engineering agents make for annoying coworkers",
      description: "I want my agents to be easy to prompt, to be able to test their work, and to be able to fit within my SDLC.",

    {
      title: "Use an LLM to create a SQL query representing the data I want to expose",
