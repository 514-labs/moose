# Introduction

Aggregations in Moose are reusable queries that compute derived data or summary statistics from your raw data.
One way of thinking about how Aggregations are different from Flows is that Aggregations are functions that run on your data inside your database.
They are functions for calculating, summarizing, combining, and/or deriving new data from the data across your database tables.
Flows, on the other hand, are functions for processing, cleaning, mapping, or augmenting individual events or batches of events in memory in a NodeJS runtime.
Aggregations are best served after all of your data is ingested, transformed, and landed in your database, so you can make your data staged and ready to be consumed.

The result set of these queries is pre-computed and saved as dedicated tables in your database, enabling integration into various
parts of your application for enhanced metrics and insights.

These aggregated values can be used in analysis, reporting, and dashboards to aid decision-making.
Aggregation also optimizes database performance by reducing the number of queries needed to process data.
