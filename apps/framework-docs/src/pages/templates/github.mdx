## Getting Started

<Steps>
### Clone the repository:
To get started with this template, you can run the following command:

```bash filename="terminal" copy
npx create-moose-app moose-github-dev-trends github-dev-trends
```

### Install dependencies:
```bash filename="terminal" copy
cd moose-github-dev-trends/moose && npm install
```

## Project Structure

```
moose-github-dev-trends/
├── live-dev-trends-dashboard/ # Frontend dashboard application
├── moose-backend/ # Backend services
└── README.md # Project documentation
```


### Run the application

```bash filename="terminal" copy
npm run dev
```

### Start the Workflow to Poll GitHub for Trending Topics

This workflow will run a script every 60 seconds to poll GitHub for trending topics:

```bash filename="terminal" copy
moose workflow run getGithubEvents
```

<Callout type="info" title="Scheduled Workflows">
The workflow is scheduled to run every 60 seconds. [Learn how to schedule workflows here] (/moose/building/workflows#scheduling-workflows).
</Callout>


### (Bonus) Create a `.env` file and add your GitHub API Key
You will be able to poll the GitHub API without any authentication credentials, but you will be limited to 60 requests per hour.

To increase the limit, you can create a `.env` file and add your GitHub personal access token.

```bash filename="terminal" copy
touch .env
```

```.env filename=".env" copy
GITHUB_TOKEN=<your-github-api-key>
```
 **DO NOT COMMIT THIS FILE TO VERSION CONTROL**:
```gitignore filename=".gitignore" copy
.env
```

</Steps>

## Explore the Data

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
cd moose-github-dev-trends/live-dev-trends-dashboard && npm install && npm run dev
```

<Callout type="info" title="View the Dashboard">
Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the dashboard.
</Callout>

### Explore the API Powering the Dashboard

The dashboard is powered by a Consumption API in the `moose` project. The code is located in the `app/apis/topicTimeseries.ts` file.
