# CLI Reference

The Sloan CLI is a tool we created to facilitate the easy setup of Sloan MCPs. It is not required, and we hope that LLM clients will eventually support all these features natively, so that we can remove the CLI.

It allows you to:
- set up your Sloan MCP with a variety of clients
- manage multiple projects
- manage multiple toolsets
- update multiple MCP configurations at once

## Install CLI

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
bash -i <(curl -fsSL https://fiveonefour.com/install.sh) sloan
```

## Commands

### init

Creates a data engineering project with Moose, with Sloan MCP preconfigured.

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
sloan init <project-name> <template-name> <--mcp <host>> <--location <location>> 
```

<ArgTable
  heading="Common Arguments & Flags"
  args={[
    {
      name: "<name>",
      required: true,
      description: "Name of your application (this will be the <project-name>).",
      examples: ["e.g. my-app"]
    },
    {
      name: "--mcp <host>",
      description: "Choice of which MCP host to use.",
      examples: ["default: cursor-project", "other options: cursor-global", "claude-desktop", "windsurf-global"]
    },
    {
      name: "--location <location>",
      description: "Location of your app or service. The default is the name of the project.",
      examples: ["e.g. my-app"]
    },
    {
      name: "--no-fail-already-exists",
      description: "By default, the init command fails if `location` exists, to prevent accidental reruns. This flag disables the check."
    }
  ]}
/>

  args={[
    {
      name: "<template-name>",
      required: true,
      description: "The template you are basing your application on.",
      examples: ["typescript-empty", "typescript", "ads-b"]
    }
  ]}
/> 

<ArgTable
  heading="For Projects from a Pre-existing ClickHouse Database"
  args={[
    {
      name: "--from-remote <connection-string>",
      required: true,
      description: "The connection string to your ClickHouse database.",

      required: true,
      description: "The language of your application.",
      examples: ["typescript", "python"]
    }
  ]}
/>

### connect

Connects to an existing data source. Currently only `clickhouse` is supported.

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
sloan connect clickhouse <--connection-string <connection-string>> <--mcp <claude-desktop>>
```

<ArgTable
  heading="Arguments / Flags"
  args={[
    {
      name: "--connection-string <connection-string>",
      required: true,
      description: "The connection string to your ClickHouse database.",
      examples: ["e.g. clickhouse://user:pass@host:port/db"]
    },
    {
      name: "--mcp <host>",
      description: "Choice of which MCP host to use.",
      examples: ["default: cursor-project", "other options: cursor-global", "claude-desktop", "windsurf-global"]
    }
  ]}
/>

### setup

Takes an existing data engineering project build with Moose and configures Sloan MCP for it.

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
sloan setup [path] <tools> <--mcp <host>>
```

<ArgTable
  heading="Arguments / Flags"
  args={[
    {
      name: "[path]",
      description: "Path to the Moose project.",
      examples: ["defaults to current directory"]
    },
    {
      name: "--mcp <host>",
      description: "Choice of which MCP host to use. If flag is not provided, the default is `cursor-project`.",
      examples: ["default: cursor-project", "other options: claude-desktop", "cursor-global", "cursor-project", "windsurf-global"]
    },
    {
      name: "--<tools>",
      description: "Setup Sloan MCP to already have access to Moose read tools",
      examples: ["--moose-read-tools", "--moose-write-tools", "--remote-clickhouse-tools"]
    }
  ]}
/>

### config

Configure Sloan settings

#### config focus

Sloan allows you to configure project level MCPs (e.g. for Cursor) and global MCPs (e.g. for Claude Desktop). To configure which Sloan project is being used with the Global MCPS, use `sloan config focus`.

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
sloan config focus
```

#### config keys

Updates all MCP files for projects listed in ~/.sloan/sloan-config.toml to use updated API key.

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
sloan config keys <KEY>
```

<ArgTable
  heading="Arguments / Flags"
  args={[
    {
      name: "<KEY>",
      required: true,
      description: "Your Anthropic API key. If you don't have an Anthropic API key, see the Anthropic initial setup guide: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/initial-setup"
    }
  ]}
/>

#### config tools

Toggles availability of experimental MCP tools. See [Tools Reference](/sloan/reference/tool-reference).

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
sloan config tools
```

Note: if you select `remote-clickhouse`, you will need to add your ClickHouse Cloud / Boreal credentials to `mcp.json`.
