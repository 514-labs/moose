import { Callout, Tabs, Steps } from "nextra/components";

## Prerequisites

Before using MooseJS, ensure you have the following dependencies installed on your machine:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- macOS or Linux (Windows is not supported at this time, but may work using WSL Windows Subsystem for Linux)

To check if these dependencies are installed, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
git --version && node --version && docker --version
```

---

## Create Moose App

In your terminal, run:

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
npx create-moose-app@latest my-moose-app
```

This will automatically create a new project folder and initialize a skeleton Moose app with the entire project structure you need to get started.

### Install Dependencies

Navigate to your project directory and install project dependencies:

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
cd my-moose-app && npm install
```

---

## Start Local Dev Server

<Callout>
  Make sure Docker is running before you start your dev server. This is required
  because the local instances of Clickhouse and Redpanda are running inside
  containers.
</Callout>

Start your local development server to run your entire app,

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
npx moose-cli dev
```

This server operates all the infrastructure powering your application: a web server with API endpoints to ingest & consume data, a Redpanda platform to buffer data, and a Clickhouse database to store and query data for insights. The local dev server configures these components based on your code and updates them in real time as your application code changes.

### Inspect Infrastructure

Check that the infrastructure is setup according to the default starter code in your project by running:

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
npx moose-cli ls
```

You should see the following table in your terminal:

![moose-ls](/moose-ls.png)

---

## Open Project in IDE

### VSCode Users: Install Recommended Extensions

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
code .
```

Opening your project in VSCode will prompt a recommendation to install the [SQLTools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mtxr.sqltools) and [SQLTools ClickHouse Driver](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ultram4rine.sqltools-clickhouse-driver) extensions. Installing these allows Moose to auto-configure them for your local ClickHouse database, letting you explore and query your data immediately.

### Explore Data Models

In your IDE file explorer, navigate to the `/app` folder of your project and open the `datamodels` directory. You should see a file named `models.ts` . Open the file and inspect the data models:

```ts filename="/datamodels/models.ts" copy
import { Key } from "@514labs/moose-lib";

export interface UserActivity {
  eventId: Key<string>;
  timestamp: string;
  userId: string;
  activity: string;
}

export interface ParsedActivity {
  eventId: Key<string>;
  timestamp: Date;
  userId: string;
  activity: string;
}
```

The file contains schema definitions for two data models: `UserActivity` and `ParsedActivity`. Each model defines the structure of the data that will be ingested into the Clickhouse database. Recall from the `moose-ls` output that Moose has automatically created ingestion points and tables in your database for these data models.

---

## Ingest Data

Let's send some sample data to the `UserActivity` data model via the `/ingest/UserActivity/0.0` endpoint that Moose created for us. Run the following command:

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
curl -X POST \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"eventId": "1234567890", "timestamp": "2019-01-01 00:00:01", "userId": "123456", "activity": "click"}' \
http://localhost:4000/ingest/UserActivity

```

You should see a bunch of messages in the CLI confirming that Moose received the data. Let's double-check that the new data landed in our `UserActivity_0_0` table in our database.

In your SQL explorer, execute the following query:

```sql filename="DB Explorer" copy
SELECT * FROM local.UserActivity
```

### Query Data

Follow the steps below to get started with querying your data using either the SQLTools VSCode extension or your preferred database explorer tool.

<Tabs items={['Using the SQLTools VSCode Extension', 'Using Your Own Database Explorer']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    #### Using the SQLTools VSCode Extension:
    Click the SQLTools database icon in your extensions tab. You should see the Clickhouse icon followed by the connection details for the database running on your local dev server: `panda@localhost:18123/local`. 
    
    
    ![SQL Tools Setup](/sqltools.png)

    To create and run a new query, click the `New SQL File` icon.

  </Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
  #### Using a Database Explorer:
  The following steps will guide you through configuring your preferred database explorer tool, such as DBeaver or DataGrip, to connect to the Clickhouse database instance that Moose will spin up for you on your local dev server.

- Open your database explorer and navigate to the section for adding a new database connection.
- Enter the connection details as follows:

```text filename="moose.project.toml" copy
[clickhouse config]
  db_name = "local"
  user = "panda"
  password = "pandapass"
  host = "localhost"
  host_port = 18123
```

- Test and save the connection. You should now see the `local` database in your database explorer tool.

<Callout type="info">
  You can find all the infrastructure configuration details in the
  moose.project.toml file in your project's root directory
</Callout>

</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

Execute the following query:

```sql filename="DB Explorer" copy
SELECT * FROM local.UserActivity
```

You should see the data you ingested in the `UserActivity` table.

## Next Steps

Congrats! You've successfully set up a Moose project, ingested data, and confirmed that it landed in your database. You're now ready to dive deeper and explore all the exciting capabilities that Moose has to offer. Here are some suggested next steps to further leverage Moose's powerful features:

#### Learn Other Moose Primitives

After ingesting the data, you might have noticed the CLI message: `Received UserActivity_0_0 -> ParsedActivity_0_0 1 message(s).` This indicates that Moose successfully transformed the data from the `UserActivity` model to the `ParsedActivity` model. Moose did this by executing the transformation function defined in the `UserActivity__ParsedActivity.ts` file in the `/functions/` folder on the `UserActivity` data sample you ingested. You can learn more about how to define execute custom transformation functions on your data by checking out the [Streaming Functions documentation](/building/streaming-functions/setup).

Streaming functions are one of the three remaining Moose primitives left for you to explore. For a quick overview on how to get started with Streaming Functions and the other primitives, refer to the [Quick Reference section](/quick-reference).

#### Add a New Data Model

Define and save a new data model in the `/datamodels/models.ts` file to automatically create ingestion points and tables in your database for the new model. Check out the data models documentation to learn about other ways to take advantage of Moose's data modeling capabilities, including the types of data models you can define and how to leverage Moose's auto-generated SDKs to ingest data from your other applications into Moose.

Check out the [Data Models documentation](/building/data-models/intro) to for a deeper dive.

#### Understand your Project Structure

Explore the docs to learn more about [your project structure](/getting-started/project-structure) or the [architecture of your new app](/getting-started/architecture).
