# Infrastructure Planning

Infrastructure planning in Moose works similarly to version control systems like Git, but for your infrastructure. It helps you manage and track changes to your data infrastructure with confidence.

## Overview

Moose's planning functionality:
- Compares current infrastructure state with desired state
- Generates detailed plans for infrastructure changes
- Validates changes before applying them
- Provides development and production workflows

<Callout type="info" title="Infrastructure Components">
Moose tracks changes across:
- OLAP Database Tables
- Streaming Engine Topics
- API Endpoints
- Background Processes
</Callout>

## Using Planning

### Development Mode

Development mode automatically plans and applies changes as you work:

<TypeScript>
```bash filename="Terminal" copy
npx moose-cli dev
```
</TypeScript>

<Python>
```bash filename="Terminal" copy
moose-cli dev
```
</Python>

This will:
1. Watch for changes in your code
2. Automatically plan infrastructure updates
3. Apply changes locally
4. Provide immediate feedback

### Remote Planning

For production deployments, use remote planning to preview changes:

<TypeScript>
```bash filename="Terminal" copy
npx moose-cli plan --url https://your-production-instance
```
</TypeScript>

<Python>
```bash filename="Terminal" copy
moose-cli plan --url https://your-production-instance
```
</Python>

<Callout type="warning" title="Authentication Required">
Remote planning requires authentication. You can configure your moose server with the following steps:

1. Generate a token using `moose-cli auth generate`
2. Project config for the server check: 
```toml filename="moose.config.toml" copy
[authentication]
admin_api_key = "your-hashed-token"
```
3. Supply the token when running `moose-cli plan`: `--token your-auth-token`

</Callout>

### Understanding Plan Output

When you run a plan, Moose shows you what will change:

```bash
Infrastructure Changes:
✨ New Components
  + analytics_table (OLAP Table)
  + metrics_topic (Streaming Topic)
  + api/v2/metrics (API Endpoint)

🔄 Modified Components
  ~ users_table (Schema Update)
  ~ events_topic (Config Change)

❌ Removed Components
  - deprecated_process (Background Process)
```

## Planning Workflow

### 1. Development Flow

During local development:
1. Run `moose dev` to start development mode
2. Make changes to your data models or configuration
3. Moose automatically plans and applies changes
4. View changes in real-time through the CLI

### 2. Production Deployment Flow

For production deployments:
1. Develop and test changes locally
2. Run remote planning against production
3. Review planned changes
4. Apply changes using your deployment process

## Best Practices

### Development
- Use `moose dev` for local development
- Monitor plan outputs for warnings

### Production
- Always use remote planning before deployments
- Review changes carefully in production plans
- Maintain proper authentication (as a default the admin endpoint will be returning 401 Unauthorized if the token is not configured)

## Troubleshooting

1. **Authentication Errors**
   - Verify your authentication token
   - Generate a new token using `moose-cli auth generate`
