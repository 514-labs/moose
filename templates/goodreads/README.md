This is a [Moose](https://docs.fiveonefour.com/moose) project bootstrapped with [`moose init`](https://docs.fiveonefour.com/moose/reference/moose-cli#init) or [`sloan init`](https://docs.fiveonefour.com/sloan/cli-reference#init)

## Getting Started

Prerequisites
* [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en)
* [A Kaggle API Key](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/api)
* [An Anthropic API Key](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/getting-started)
* [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) or [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download)

1. Install Moose / Sloan: `bash -i <(curl -fsSL https://fiveonefour.com/install.sh) moose,sloan`
2. Create project `sloan init books goodreads`
3. Install dependencies: `cd books && npm install`
4. Add your Kaggle Settings file to authenticate (For more information, see https://www.kaggle.com/docs/api)
5. Run Moose: `moose dev`
You are ready to go!

You can start editing the app by modifying primitives in the `app` subdirectory. The dev server auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project gets data from http://adsb.lol.
