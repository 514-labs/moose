# Data Egress

## Create analytics APIs to serve your data

This demo will walk you through using Sloan tools to prompt your way to creating analytics APIs that serve the aircraft telemetry data you've ingested.

[Skip to prompt](#prompt-the-llm-to-create-a-geolocation-api) if you started with the ads-b template.

<Callout type="info" title="Prerequisites">
- **Sloan and Moose CLIs**: [Install them here](/sloan/getting-started/cursor)
- **OS**: macOS or Linux (WSL supported for Windows)
- **Docker Desktop/Engine**: [24.0.0+](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)
- **Node**: [version 20+](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (LTS recommended)
- **Anthropic API Key**: [Get one here](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/initial-setup)
- **Client**: [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) 
- **Completed**: [Ingest Demo](/sloan/demos/ingest) (or have data already in your system)
</Callout>

<Steps>

### Start with the ads-b template

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
sloan init egress-demo ads-b
```

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
cd egress-demo
npm install
```

### Run the Moose Dev Server

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
moose dev 
```

### Open the project in Cursor

### Initialize the Sloan MCP

Navigate to `Cursor > Settings > Cursor Settings > Tools and Integrations` then toggle on the `Sloan MCP` tool.

### For best results, set the LLM to `claude-4-sonnet`

Gemini 2.5 and o3 are also reasonably good, but claude-4-sonnet has the most consistent results.

### Prompt the LLM to create a geolocation API

> Can you create an API that returns every aircraft within X miles of Y,Z coordinates.

### Action

The LLM should now use sloan tools to:
1. create the analytics API endpoint that calculates distance and filters aircraft
2. test the API to ensure it's working correctly with the existing aircraft data

You'll know it is succeeding if:
1. the LLM successfully tests the API
2. you can curl the API generated
3. you can see the generated openapi spec in `path/to/your/project/.moose/openapi.yaml`
