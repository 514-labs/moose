# Packaging Moose for deployment

Once you've developed your Moose application locally, you can package it for deployment to your on-prem or cloud infrastructure.

The first step is to `cd` into your moose project.

```txt filename="Terminal" copy
cd my-moose-app3
```

The moose-cli you've used to build your moose project also has a handy flag that will automate the packaging and building of your project into docker images.

```txt filename="Terminal" copy
npx @514labs/moose-cli build --docker
```

After the above command completes you can view your newly created docker files by running the `docker images` command:

```txt filename="Terminal" copy
>docker images
REPOSITORY                                              TAG               IMAGE ID       CREATED              SIZE
moose-df-deployment-aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu           0.3.175           c50674c7a68a   About a minute ago   155MB
moose-df-deployment-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu            0.3.175           e5b449d3dea3   About a minute ago   163MB
```

> Notice that you get two `moose-df-deployment` containers, one for the `aarch64` (ARM64) architecture and another for the `x86_64` architecture. This is necessary to allow you to choose the version that matches your cloud or on-prem machine architecture.

You can then use standard docker commands to push your new project images to your container repository of choice.

First tag your local images:

```txt filename="Terminal" copy
docker tag moose-df-deployment-aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu:0.3.136 {your-repo-user-name}/moose-df-deployment-aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu:0.3.136
docker tag moose-df-deployment-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu:0.3.136 {your-repo-user-name}/moose-df-deployment-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu:0.3.136
```

Then `push` your files to your container repository.

```txt filename="Terminal" copy
docker push {your-repo-user-name}/moose-df-deployment-aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu:0.3.175
docker push {your-repo-user-name}/moose-df-deployment-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu:0.3.175
```

You can also use the following handy shell script to automate the two steps above.

```bash filename="push.sh" copy
#!/bin/bash

version=$2

if [ -z "$1" ]
then
      echo "You must specify the dockerhub repository as an argument. Example: ./push.sh container-repo-name"
      echo "Note: you can also provide a second argument to supply a specific version tag - otherwise this script will use the same version as the latest moose-cli on Github."
      exit 1
fi

if [ -z "$2" ]
then
      output=$(npx @514labs/moose-cli -V)
      version=$(echo "$output" | sed -n '2p' | awk '{print $2}')
fi

echo "Using version: $version"
arch="moose-df-deployment-aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu"
docker tag $arch:$version $1/$arch:$version
docker push $1/$arch:$version

arch="moose-df-deployment-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu"
docker tag $arch:$version $1/$arch:$version
docker push $1/$arch:$version
```
