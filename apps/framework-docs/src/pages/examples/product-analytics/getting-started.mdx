# Quick Start Guide

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js and Docker installed on your machine. You can check if they are installed by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash filename="terminal" copy
docker --version && node --version
```

If you don't have them installed, you can download them from the following links:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

## Download the Template Starter Code

To create a new project, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
npx create-moose-app@latest moose-product-analytics --template product-analytics
```

You can optionally replace `moose-product-analytics` with your desired project name.

### Project Structure

This command will create a new project directory named `moose-product-analytics` with the following structure:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="moose-product-analytics" open>
    <FileTree.Folder name="moose">
      <FileTree.Folder name="app" open>
        <FileTree.Folder name="datamodels">
          <FileTree.File name="models.ts" />
        </FileTree.Folder>
        <FileTree.Folder name="functions">
          <FileTree.File name="PageViewRaw__PageViewProcessed.ts" />
        </FileTree.Folder>
        <FileTree.Folder name="blocks" />
        <FileTree.Folder name="apis" />
      </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.Folder name="next">
      <FileTree.Folder name="app" />
      <FileTree.Folder name="public" open>
        <FileTree.File name="script.js" />
      </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

The project directory contains two subdirectories:

- `moose`: Hosts the Moose application code for your backend clickstream event processing service
- `next`: Hosts frontend analytics dashboard code and a helper script for capturing client-side events

<Callout type="info">
  The `moose` and `next` folders can run separately. Optionally, you can use a
  different frontend like Grafana or query the database directly to consume the
  captured and processed data.
</Callout>

## Running the Moose Application Locally

### Start Docker

First make sure Docker is running on your machine:

```bash filename="terminal" copy
docker info
```

### Start Moose Development Server

Navigate to the `moose` project directory and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash filename="terminal" copy
cd moose-product-analytics/moose && npm install
```

Now, start your Moose development server by running the following command:

```bash filename="terminal" copy
npx moose-cli dev
```

You should see a message in the CLI indicating the development server is running at `http://localhost:4000`.

<Callout>
Did you know?

The development server contains all the backend infrastructure needed to ingest, buffer, process, store, and query event data. [Learn more about the Moose development server architecture.](/getting-started/architecture)

</Callout>

### Understanding the Provided Starter Code

Open your project in your favorite IDE. Once your project is open, navigate to the `/datamodels` folder inside the `/app` directory. Open the `models.ts` file. You will see a pre-defined `PageViewRaw` data model:

```tsx filename="moose/app/datamodels/models.ts" copy
import { Key } from "@514labs/moose-lib"

export interface PageViewRaw {
    eventId    Key<string>
    timestamp  DateTime
    session_id String
    user_agent String
    locale     String
    location   String
    href       String
    pathname   String
    referrer   String
}

```

<Callout>
  The `PageViewRaw` data model is a good starting point for capturing web page
  views.
</Callout>

### Verify the Moose Infrastructure

When you run your local development server (via `moose-cli dev`), Moose automatically configures the infrastructure to ingest data that fits this schema.
Open a new terminal window and see for yourself! Ensure you are in the `moose` project directory, and run:

```bash filename="terminal" copy
npx moose-cli ls
```

<Callout>
  The `ls` command lists all the APIs and tables that Moose has created for you
  based on the Data Models you have defined. [Learn more about the `ls`
  command](/moose-cli#list).
</Callout>

You should now see a table showing the following:

![Moose ls](/moose-ls-pa.png)

As you can see, Moose has already set up the necessary infrastructure, including:

- An `ingest/PageViewRaw` API endpoint running on a web server for posting new `PageViewRaw` data samples from your web application.
- A `PageViewRaw` table in a Clickhouse database where Moose will store the ingested events.

Now you are ready to start instrumenting your web app to send live clickstream data to Moose.
