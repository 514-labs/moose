## Quickstart: Ad hoc analytics with Clickhouse Playground or your own Clickhouse database

This will walk you through using Aurora CLI to connect Aurora MCP tools to your Clickhouse database, allowing you to chat with your data in your client of choice. We'll use the Clickhouse Playground as our example database, but you can use any Clickhouse database.

<Callout type="info" title="Prerequisites">
- **OS**: macOS or Linux (WSL supported for Windows)
- **Node**: [version 20+](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (LTS recommended)
- **Client**: [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) or [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) or [Windsurf](https://windsurf.ai/download). For this particular use-case, we recommend Claude Desktop.
</Callout>

<Steps>
### Install Aurora CLI

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
bash -i <(curl -fsSL https://fiveonefour.com/install.sh) aurora
```

### Configure your Aurora MCP

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
aurora connect clickhouse --connection-string "clickhouse://explorer:@play.clickhouse.com:443/default" --mcp cursor-project
```

This will configure the [Clickhouse MCP tools](https://docs.fiveonefour.com/aurora/tool-reference#remote-clickhouse) to read data from Clickhouse's Playground, but you can point this at any Clickhouse database. It sets up the MCP in Claude Desktop, but you can change this with the `--mcp` flag.

### Chat

Open your Claude Desktop client. 

You can check that the MCP is correctly configured by looking at `claude > settings > developer > aurora`. It should say "running".

You can can also look at `search and tools` beneath the chat window, you should see `aurora` in the list of MCPs—if you click into it, you should see the tools that are enabled.

We recommend starting the chat with a context setting question like "tell me about the data I have available to me in Clickhouse".
