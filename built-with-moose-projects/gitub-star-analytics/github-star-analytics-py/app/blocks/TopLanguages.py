# This file is where you can define your SQL queries to shape and manipulate batches
# of data using Blocks. Blocks can also manage materialized views to store the results of 
# your queries for improved performance. A materialized view is the recommended approach for aggregating
# data. For more information on the types of aggregate functions you can run on your existing data, 
# consult the Clickhouse documentation: https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/aggregate-functions
