# Capturing Page View Events

In this section, you will learn how to capture page view events from a web application and send them to Moose for processing.

The analytics template includes a helper script that sends `PageViewRaw` data to the `ingest/PageViewRaw` API endpoint on your local dev server. This script automatically triggers and sends new events and sets all properties defined in the `PageViewRaw` Data Model.

### Locating the Script

The `script.js` file can be found in the `/public` folder of the `next` project. When you run the NextJS Dashboard, it serves this tracking script so you can import it into your web app.

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="moose-product-analytics" open>
    <FileTree.Folder name="moose" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="next" open>
      <FileTree.Folder name="app" />
      <FileTree.Folder name="public" open>
        <FileTree.File name="script.js" />
      </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

### Start NextJS Dev Server

Open a new terminal window to start your NextJS dashboard application. First, navigate to the `next` directory and install dependencies:

```bash filename="terminal" copy
cd moose-product-analytics/next && npm install
```

Then, start the NextJS development server:

```bash filename="terminal" copy
npm run dev
```

<Callout>
  Note the port number used (typically `3000`), as it is needed for setting up
  event tracking in the following steps.
</Callout>

## Adding the Script to Your Application

To add the tracking script to your web application, insert the following script tag into the `<head>` section of your web application's HTML:

```html
<script
  data-host="<http://localhost:4000>"
  data-event="PageViewRaw/0.0"
  src="<http://localhost:3000/script.js>"
></script>
```

Here are the key points to note:

- **`data-host` Attribute:** This should point to the URL of your Moose ingestion web server, which is typically `http://localhost:4000` when running locally. This ensures that all captured data is sent to the correct endpoint.
- **`src` Attribute:** This should point to the URL where your tracking script is served, which is typically `http://localhost:3000/script.js` when running the Next.js server locally. Replace `3000` with the port number your Next.js server is running on, if different.

With this script tag now included, your web application should be all set up to send `PageViewRaw` data to Moose.

## Test it Out!

Run your web app locally and navigate the pages. In the browser's developer console, check the network tab for `POST` requests to `http://localhost:4000/ingest/PageViewRaw`.

To confirm Moose received these events, look for `Success` messages in the terminal where you started the Moose server.

To check the data in the `PageViewRaw` table in Clickhouse, connect to the database using credentials in `moose.project.toml` under `[clickhouse config]`. For more details, [follow these instructions](https://docs.moosejs.com/getting-started/new-project#query-data).
