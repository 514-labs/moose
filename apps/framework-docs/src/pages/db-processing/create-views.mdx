# Creating Views and Materialized Views

`moose-lib` provides a helper function called `createAggregation()` that you can use to create a new Materialized View. This function takes in a `select` statement and an `orderBy` statement, and returns a new Materialized View object.

<Callout type="info" title="What are Materialized Views?">
  In Moose, the result set of the Materialized Views query is stored in a
  dedicated table in your database. When new data is added to the source table,
  the database updates the materialized view with the aggregated data.
</Callout>

### createAggregation()

The `createAggregation()` function is a utility provided by `moose-lib` to create Materialized Views:

| Key       | Description                                                                                       | Required |
| :-------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------: |
| `name`    | The name of the view to create                                                                    |      Yes |
| `select`  | A valid Clickhouse SQL `SELECT` query that aggregates data                                        |      Yes |
| `orderBy` | Columns that define the primary key for the target table where your query results will be stored. |      Yes |

<Callout type="info" title="Workflow Tip">
  [Test your query in a SQL explorer for a more efficient workflow.]() Once
  satisfied, copy-paste it into the aggregation file. Be sure to validate your
  query using the [Clickhouse SQL
  Reference](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/aggregate-functions/reference)
  to ensure it adheres to Clickhouse's syntax and utilizes the available
  functions effectively.

### Examples

#### Create a Materialized View: `DailyActiveUsers`

```ts filename="blocks/DailyActiveUsers.ts" copy
import { createAggregation } from "@514labs/moose-lib";

export default createAggregation({
  name: "DailyActiveUsers",
  select: ` 
    SELECT 
        count(distinct userId) as dailyActiveUsers,
        toStartOfDay(timestamp) as date
    FROM ParsedActivity_0_0
    WHERE activity = 'Login' 
    GROUP BY toStartOfDay(timestamp)
    `,
  orderBy: "date",
}) as Blocks;
```

#### Ordering by Multiple Columns

```ts filename="blocks/DailyActiveUsers.ts" copy
import { createAggregation } from "@514labs/moose-lib";

export default createAggregation({
  name: "DailyActiveUsers",
  select: ` 
    SELECT 
        count(distinct userId) as dailyActiveUsers,
        toStartOfDay(timestamp) as date
    FROM ParsedActivity_0_0
    WHERE activity = 'Login' 
    GROUP BY toStartOfDay(timestamp)
    `,
  orderBy: "(date, userId)",
}) as Blocks;
```

### Create a View on top of a Materialized View

```ts filename="blocks/DailyActiveUsers.ts" copy

export default {
  // CREATE VIEW SQL CODE HERE
}
as Blocks;

### How the Materialized View is Created

When you save the file, Moose automatically creates a new table named and populates it with the results of the `SELECT` statement. You can then use this table in other queries to build further insights. Check out the Consumption API section of the documentation to learn how you could create an API to consume the aggregated data.

  Materialized Views in Clickhouse automatically refresh your target table with
  the latest query results whenever new data is added to your source tables.
