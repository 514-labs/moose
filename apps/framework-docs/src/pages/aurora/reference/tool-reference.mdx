# Tool Reference

Aurora CLI can allow you to use various Aurora MCP tool-sets, as well as install and configure certain external tools. 

Tools are grouped by their purpose into toolsets. Enable the toolsets you want to use by running `aurora config tools` and enabling the tools you want to use. You can also enable tools by adding them to your `mcp.json` file. 

<Callout type="info" title="Performance Tip">
The fewer tools you enable, the higher performance the agent using the tool set will have, especially with respect to tool selection.

## Read Only Moose tools
Tools needed to read the Moose project and its associated infrastructure.

### Activate this toolset

These tools are enabled by default.

To enable them explicitly, run 
```bash filename="Terminal" copy
aurora config tools
```
and enable `read-only-moose-tools`.
```txt filename="Terminal" copy
? Select experimental tools to enable (no selection defaults to read-only and egress-tools):  
  [x] read-only - Enable read-only tools for data inspection
  [ ] egress-tools - Enable egress-tools for exposing data (requires read only tools: auto enables)
  [ ] experimental-moose-tools - Enable experimental moose tools (requires read only tools: auto enables)
  [ ] remote-clickhouse - Enable Remote Clickhouse integration
  [ ] external-duck-db-mcp - Enable External DuckDB MCP integration
```

If you are managing the Aurora MCP with `mcp.json`, you can enable this toolset by adding the following to your `mcp.json`:

```json filename="MCP.json" copy
"args": [
  ...
  "--read-only", 
  ...
]
```

### When is this toolset useful?
* When you are exploring data in your Moose project: *"Tell me about the data in my Moose project", "Tell me about the data in my `consumption` table"*,  *"Tell me about the data streams in my Moose project"*, *"Describe my DLQ topic"*, *"Tell me about the data in my `enrichment` data stream"*
* When you are expanding, modifying or debugging your Moose project (also requires `write-moose-tools`): *"Did data land in my `consumption` table?", "Did the data in my `consumption` table change?", "Did my materialized view update?"*
* When you want to check the status of your Moose development server, usually whilst debugging new primitive creation (for the second part, also requires `write-moose-tools`): *"Is my Moose development server running?", "Is my Moose development server healthy?", "Did my new workflow kill my local dev server?"*

### Tools

#### `read_moose_project`
Retrieves an infrastructure map from the local Moose development server. Retrieves a list of all primitives in the project (e.g. Data Models, Workflows, Streaming Functions, Materialized Views, APIs), as well as their associated infrastructure (e.g. ClickHouse tables, Redpanda topics, etc.).

#### `read_clickhouse_tables`
Queries local ClickHouse.

#### `read_redpanda_topic`
Reads from local Redpanda. 

#### `check_moose_status`
Checks the status of the Moose project. Useful for debugging.

## Write Moose tools 

Tools needed to create and test Moose primitives. These are used to ingest data, transform data and create egress patterns for data in your project.

### Activate this toolset

These tools are enabled by default (except for in Claude Desktop, where these tools aren't recommended).
These tools require that the `read-only-moose-tools` toolset is enabled.

To enable them explicitly, run 
```bash filename="Terminal" copy
aurora config tools
```
and enable `read-only-moose-tools`.
```txt filename="Terminal" copy
? Select experimental tools to enable (no selection defaults to read-only and egress-tools):  
  [x] read-only - Enable read-only tools for data inspection
  [x] egress-tools - Enable egress-tools for exposing data (requires read only tools: auto enables)
  [ ] experimental-moose-tools - Enable experimental moose tools (requires read only tools: auto enables)
  [ ] remote-clickhouse - Enable Remote Clickhouse integration
  [ ] external-duck-db-mcp - Enable External DuckDB MCP integration
```


If you are managing the Aurora MCP with `mcp.json`, you can enable this toolset by adding the following to your `mcp.json`:

```json filename="MCP.json" copy
"args": [
  ...
  "--moose-tools", 
  ...
]
```
### When is this toolset useful?

* When you are creating new Moose primitives: *"I want to create a new data model for the following API source: ...; documented here: ..."*, *"I want to create a new workflow to ingest data from the following API source: ...; documented here: ..."*, *"I want to create a new streaming function to enrich the data from this data stream with the following API source: ...; documented here: ..."*, *"I want to create a new materialized view that will improve the performance of the `aircraft` API"*
* When you are trying to create a new Moose project: *"I want to create a new Moose project that ingests data from the following API sources: ..., enriches them in stream from the following API: ..., creates a materialized view that ..., and creates egress APIs that allow the following visualizations to be built: ..."*
* When you want to create new data products: *"I want to create a new data product that will allow me to visualize the following data: ...; use the following API sources: ...; create the following materialized views: ...; create and test the performance ofthe following egress APIs: ..."*
* When you want to create new consumption patterns: *"I want to make this data model available for consumption as a stream or an API with the following parameters: ..."*
* When you want to fix upstream data issues: *"Look at my DLQ topic, create a streaming function subscribed to that topic conforming the data to the form expected by the following data model: ..."*
* When you want to improve the performance of your data products: *"Create materialized views that will improve the performance of the following egress APIs: ...", "Look at the chats people are having with my ... data model, create a materialized view that will improve the performance of the dominant query patterns."*

### Usage tips

* Consider the flow of data through your Moose project when creating new primitives. For example, if you want to create a streaming function, the `write_stream_function` tool will have a much better chance of success if there is a data sample, a source and a destination data model in place.
* Many of the tools have testing corrolaries (and for the ones that don't, there are general purpose tools that can allow the agent to test the created primitive, like `read_moose_project`, `read_clickhouse_tables`, `read_redpanda_topic`). Use those testing tools to ensure that the agent is doing what you intend it to do.
* Step by step prompting (e.g. "Get sample data from X API", "Create an ingest data model", "Create a workflow to periodically grab data from the API", ...) has a higher success rate than trying to one-shot the entire project creation flow.

### Tools

## Experimental: Remote ClickHouse Tools  (Alpha)

Tools for reading data in your external ClickHouse database (e.g. those hosted in Boreal or ClickHouse Cloud). These are useful for iterating off a production project, for debugging production issues or for local testing of changes to production data.

<Callout type="warning" title="Read-only credentials">
  For an abundance of caution, we suggest using read-only credentials for this toolset. [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/operations/access-rights). If you want to modify your ClickHouse database, we suggest using Moose to do so.
</Callout>

### Activate this toolset

These tools are **not** enabled by default.
To enable them explicitly, run `aurora config tools` and enable `remote-clickhouse`. If you use `aurora config tools` to enable this toolset, you will still need to manually add the environment variables to your `mcp.json` file.

If you are managing the Aurora MCP with `mcp.json`, you can enable this toolset by adding the following to your `mcp.json`:

```json filename="MCP.json" copy
"args": [
  ...
  "--remote-clickhouse", 
  ...
]
"env": {
  ...
  "BOREAL_CLICKHOUSE_HOST": "...",
  "BOREAL_CLICKHOUSE_PORT": "...",
  "BOREAL_CLICKHOUSE_USER": "...",
  "BOREAL_CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD": "...",
  "BOREAL_CLICKHOUSE_DATABASE": "...",
}
```
