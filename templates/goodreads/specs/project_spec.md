## Data Sources

### Pull Sources
Primary: Goodreads API
- Endpoint: `/books`
- Frequency: Daily update for new books
- Batch size: 10,000 records per request
- Rate limits: Comply with Goodreads API limitations

### Batch Sources
Historical Data Import
- Initial load from Goodreads database dumps
- Format: CSV/JSON files
- Volume: Millions of records
- Processing: ETL pipeline with data validation and cleaning

## Data Quality Requirements
- No duplicate book_id entries
- Title and authors fields must not be null
- Average rating must be between 0 and 5
- ISBN/ISBN13 must follow standard format when present
- Page count must be positive when present
- Ratings and reviews counts must be non-negative
- Publication date must not be in the future

## Assumptions Made
1. Goodreads API or data dumps are available as data sources
2. Multiple authors are stored as a delimited string in the authors field
3. Language codes follow ISO 639-2 standard
4. Rating granularity is two decimal places
5. Book information updates are needed daily
6. System handles multiple editions of the same book as separate entries

*Note: This specification assumes integration with Goodreads' data ecosystem. If using different data sources, the integration approach would need to be adjusted accordingly.*
