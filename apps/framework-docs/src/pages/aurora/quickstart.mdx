# Quickstart: Aurora MCPs

Get started with Aurora by:

- *Chatting with your data in Clickhouse in as little as 3 commands*: Connect your LLM client to a Clickhouse database and explore it using natural language. This uses the Clickhouse Playground as our example database, but you can use any Clickhouse database. Quickstart uses the Clickhouse Playground, but you can use your own Clickhouse database.

- *Building out new egress patterns from Clickhouse with Aurora MCP tools in 5 minutes*: Spin up a local dev server with a mirror of your production Clickhouse, the data represented in simple typescript or python primitives, and new data/analytics engineering created in chat with Aurora MCP. Quickstart uses the Clickhouse Playground, but you can use your own Clickhouse database.

- *Building a complete analytics backend from a template in minutes, or starting your own projects from scratch*: Create a local dev server with Clickhouse, Redpanda and Temporal with one command. Data primitives are in simple typescript or python, and you can use Aurora MCP tools to create new primitives and egress APIs. Quickstart uses the ADS-B template, but you can use any Moose project template, or start a new project from scratch.

## Quickstart: Ad hoc analytics with Clickhouse Playground or your own Clickhouse database

This will walk you through using Aurora CLI to connect Aurora MCP tools to your Clickhouse database, allowing you to chat with your data in your client of choice. We'll use the Clickhouse Playground as our example database, but you can use any Clickhouse database.

<Callout type="info" title="Prerequisites">
- **OS**: macOS or Linux (WSL supported for Windows)
- **Node**: [version 20+](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (LTS recommended)
- **Client**: [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) or [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) or [Windsurf](https://windsurf.ai/download). For this particular use-case, we recommend Claude Desktop.
</Callout>

<Steps>
### Install Aurora CLI

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
bash -i <(curl -fsSL https://fiveonefour.com/install.sh) aurora
```

### Configure your Aurora MCP

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
aurora connect clickhouse --connection-string "clickhouse://explorer:@play.clickhouse.com:443/default" --mcp cursor-project
```

This will configure the [Clickhouse MCP tools](https://docs.fiveonefour.com/aurora/tool-reference#remote-clickhouse) to read data from Clickhouse's Playground, but you can point this at any Clickhouse database. It sets up the MCP in Claude Desktop, but you can change this with the `--mcp` flag.

### Chat

Open your Claude Desktop client. 

You can check that the MCP is correctly configured by looking at `claude > settings > developer > aurora`. It should say "running".

You can can also look at `search and tools` beneath the chat window, you should see `aurora` in the list of MCPsâ€”if you click into it, you should see the tools that are enabled.

We recommend starting the chat with a context setting question like "tell me about the data I have available to me in Clickhouse".

</Steps>

## Quickstart: Analytics engineering project from Clickhouse Playground or your own Clickhouse database

This will walk you through creating a new local Moose project reflecting the structure of your Clickhouse database. It will allow you to add data to your local dev environment from your remote Clickhouse database, and use Aurora MCP tools to enrich your project with metadata, or create new Moose primitives that you can use in your project (e.g.egress APIs). We'll use the Clickhouse Playground as our example database, but you can use any Clickhouse database.

<Steps>
### Install Moose and Aurora CLIs

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
bash -i <(curl -fsSL https://fiveonefour.com/install.sh) moose,aurora
```

We'll be using generative MCP tools here, so make sure you add your Anthropic API key in install. If you installed without adding it, you can add it later with `aurora config keys anthropic <your-api-key>`. If you need to create one, see: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/initial-setup.

### Create a new Moose project from your Clickhouse database

```aurora init my_project_name --from-remote 'clickhouse://explorer:@play.clickhouse.com:443/default' --language python --mcp cursor-project```

This will create a new Moose project from your Clickhouse database. [See Moose docs](https://docs.fiveonefour.com/moose) for more information about the project structure, and how it spins up your local development environment (including a local Clickhouse database).

The new project is called "my_project_name" and is created in the current directory. the string after `--from-remote` is the connection string to your Clickhouse database, structured as `clickhouse://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database>` (note, the Clickhouse Playground has no password).

### Install dependencies and run the dev server

Before you can run Moose's local dev server, Docker Desktop must be running.

Navigate into the project directory:

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
cd my_project_name
```

Install the dependencies: 

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
npm i
```

Run the dev server:

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
moose dev
```

### Get sample data

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
moose seed from-remote-clickhouse clickhouse://explorer:@play.clickhouse.com:443/default --rows 200
```

This will seed your local Clickhouse database with 200 rows of sample data from your remote Clickhouse databaseâ€”here, the Clickhouse Playground. You can change the number of rows with the `--rows` flag.

This will improve the context provided to Aurora's MCP tools, and make it easier to validate analytic engineering tasks.

### Set up your Client

The `aurora init` command above configured Cursor to use Aurora MCP tools. You can check this by opening Cursor and looking at `cursor > settings > cursor settings > MCP` menu. You should see `aurora` in the list of MCPs, alongside a list of tools. 

You may need to enable the MCP. Once you do so, you should see a green ðŸŸ¢ status indicator next to it.

If you would like to use a different client, you can use the following command from within the project directory:

```bash filename="Termainal" copy
aurora setup --mcp <host>
```

### Enrich project with metadata

Since we have a Moose project with sample data and some metadata, we can use this to create more metadata! 

If we ask our client "Can you add a description to each Moose primitive in this project?", the LLM will use the `write_metadata` tool to add a description to each Moose primitive.

```TypeScript filename="my_project_name/index.ts"
const acPipeline = new IngestPipeline<AircraftTrackingProcessed>(
    "AircraftTrackingProcessed",
    {
      table: true,
      stream: true,
      ingest: false,
      metadata: {
          description: "Pipeline for ingesting raw aircraft data" } // new description field!
      }
    
);
```

### Chat with your data

You can also now just chat with your client about your data! Try asking "Look at my MTA data in clickhouse, tell me about the trains that ran in the last 24 hours."

The client will use `read_moose_project`, `read_clickhouse_tables` and maybe `read_production_clickhouse` to answer your question.

### Create new Egress APIs with Aurora MCP tools

If you find a thread that you find interesting enough to want to productionize, try asking the client "can you create an egress API to furnish that data?"

The client will use `create_egress_api` and `test_egress_api` to create an egress API primitives in Moose, that will automatically deploy in your local dev environment when you save.

</Steps>

## Quickstart: New complete local OLAP project from template

This will get you started with a Moose data engineering project ingesting Aircraft Transponder data that you can use to learn about Aurora's Analytics Engineering MCP toolset.

</Callout>

<Steps>

### Install Aurora and Moose CLIs

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
bash -i <(curl -fsSL https://fiveonefour.com/install.sh) aurora,moose
```

We'll be using generative MCP tools here, so make sure you add your Anthropic API key in install. If you installed without adding it, you can add it later with `aurora config keys anthropic <your-api-key>`.  If you need to create one, see: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/initial-setup.


### Create a new Moose project from the ADS-B template

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
aurora init <project-name> ads-b
```

This will create a new Moose project using the ADS-B template to gather ADS-B (aircraft transponder) data that you can use to explore Aurora's MCP offerings. By default, it will create the project configured for use with Cursor (by creating `~/.cursor/mcp.config`), but if you would like to use Claude Desktop, append `--mcp claude-desktop`.

If you want to create an empty project, and build your own Data Models and ingestion, try `aurora init <project-name> typescript-empty` or `aurora init <project-name> python-empty`

### Install dependencies and run the dev server

Navigate into the created project directory: 

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
cd <project-name>
```

Install the dependencies: 

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
npm i
```

Run the dev server:

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
moose dev
```

### Set up your client: open Cursor and Enable the MCPs

Then open your code editor (e.g. by `cursor .`).

Cursor should prompt you to enable the MCP. If it doesn't, go to `cursor > settings > cursor settings > MCP` and enable the MCP called "aurora". Note, the tools will not all work until the dev server is run locally! Note, you might need to refresh the MCP until its status indicator shows ðŸŸ¢.

### Start Ingesting Data

Run the command to start ingesting data with the configured ingest scripts: `moose workflow run military_aircraft_tracking`

You should start to see hundreds of live datapoints ingesting instantly!

### Enrich project with metadata

Since we have a Moose project with sample data and some metadata, we can use this to create more metadata! 

If we ask our client "Can you add a description to each Moose primitive in this project?", the LLM will use the `write_metadata` tool to add a description to each Moose primitive.

```TypeScript filename="my_project_name/index.ts"
const acPipeline = new IngestPipeline<AircraftTrackingProcessed>(
    "AircraftTrackingProcessed",
    {
      table: true,
      stream: true,
      ingest: false,
      metadata: {
          description: "Pipeline for ingesting raw aircraft data" } // new description field!
      }
    
);
```

### Chat with your data

You can also now just chat with your client about your data! Try asking "What aircraft are listed in the data I have available."

The client will use `read_moose_project`, `read_clickhouse_tables` and maybe `read_production_clickhouse` to answer your question.

### Create new Egress APIs with Aurora MCP tools

If you find a thread that you find interesting enough to want to productionize, try asking the client "can you create an egress API to furnish that data?"

The client will use `create_egress_api` and `test_egress_api` to create an egress API primitives in Moose, that will automatically deploy in your local dev environment when you save.
