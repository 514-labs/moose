In this directory we have some of the projects — in Python and Typescript — we've built with Moose. From weeekend hackathonsto production grade 100TB/day observability-as-a-service products, if data ingestion, transformation and exploration is at the core, Moose is the perfect fit. 

Feel free to browse, comment and if/when you build something with Moose, we'd love to add a link to the repo here to share with the community. Please reach out to any of us on [slack](https://join.slack.com/t/moose-community/shared_invite/zt-2fjh5n3wz-cnOmM9Xe9DYAgQrNu8xKxg), and we'd be happy to roll up our sleeves and support you at any phase while you build something awesome with Moose.
