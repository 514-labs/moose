# Security & Authentication

Moose provides standard mechanisms to secure your data ingestion and administrative endpoints. Proper configuration of
these settings is crucial for protecting your Moose deployment.

## Ingest Endpoint Authentication

Ingest endpoints are the primary way data enters your Moose system. When secured, they ensure that only authorized
clients can send data. Moose supports several methods for authenticating requests to these endpoints.

All ingest authentication methods expect an `Authorization` header with a `Bearer` token.

### 1. JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

You can secure your ingest endpoints using JWTs. This method is suitable when you have an existing identity provider
or want to leverage standard token-based authentication.

**Configuration:**

To enable JWT authentication for ingest endpoints, configure the `jwt` table in your `moose.config.toml`
project file:

```toml
# moose.config.toml

# ... other project configurations ...

[jwt]
# This should be your JWT public key (often a PEM-formatted RSA public key)
# Can also be set via MOOSE_JWT_PUBLIC_KEY environment variable
secret = """
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEAy...
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----
"""
# The expected issuer of the JWT
# Can also be set via MOOSE_JWT_ISSUER environment variable
issuer = "https://my-auth-server.com/"
# The expected audience of the JWT
# Can also be set via MOOSE_JWT_AUDIENCE environment variable
audience = "my-moose-app"
# (Optional) Set to true to enforce JWT on all ingest APIs.
# Defaults to false. If false, JWT is checked if configured, but API Key can also be used.
enforce_on_all_ingest_apis = false
# (Optional) Set to true to enforce JWT on all consumption APIs.
# Defaults to false.
enforce_on_all_consumptions_apis = false
```

<Callout type="info">
  The `secret` field for JWT configuration refers to the **public key** used to verify the JWT signature.
  Environment variables (`MOOSE_JWT_PUBLIC_KEY`, `MOOSE_JWT_ISSUER`, `MOOSE_JWT_AUDIENCE`) can override these
  `moose.config.toml` settings.
</Callout>

When JWT is configured, the Moose server will validate the Bearer token as a JWT against the provided public key,
issuer, and audience.

### 2. API Key

For simpler authentication scenarios, you can use a static API key.

**Configuration:**

The primary method for configuring the ingest API key is via an environment variable.

1.  **Environment Variable (Recommended for Production):**
    Set the `MOOSE_INGEST_API_KEY` environment variable to the **hashed** API key.
    ```bash
    export MOOSE_INGEST_API_KEY=\'your_generated_hashed_key\'
    ```

<Callout type="warning">
  While you might consider adding an `ingest_api_key` field to the `[authentication]` table in `moose.config.toml`, this is not a standardly recognized field for ingest endpoints according to the core `AuthenticationConfig` structure. Prefer the `MOOSE_INGEST_API_KEY` environment variable for clarity and adherence to supported configurations.
</Callout>

The server will validate the Bearer token against this configured API key using a secure hashing mechanism (PBKDF2 HMAC SHA256).

### Generating Tokens and Hashed Keys

Moose CLI provides a utility to generate both a plain-text Bearer token and its corresponding hashed version for
storage.

```bash
moose generate hash-token
```

This command will output:
*   **ENV API Keys**: This is the **hashed key**. Use this value for `MOOSE_INGEST_API_KEY`, `MOOSE_CONSUMPTION_API_KEY`, or `MOOSE_ADMIN_TOKEN`
    environment variables, or the `admin_api_key` field in `moose.config.toml` (under the `[authentication]` table).
*   **Bearer Token**: This is the **plain-text token**. Your client applications should send this token in the
    `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.

<Callout type="info">
  **Priority for Ingest:** If both JWT (configured in the `[jwt]` table) and an API key (via `MOOSE_INGEST_API_KEY`) are configured, and
  `jwt.enforce_on_all_ingest_apis` is `false` (or not set), the system will first attempt JWT validation.
  If that fails or is not applicable, it will then try to validate using the API key. If
  `jwt.enforce_on_all_ingest_apis` is `true`, only JWT will be accepted if JWT is configured.
</Callout>

## Consumption API Authentication

Consumption APIs, which expose your data to external systems or applications, can also be secured. The authentication
mechanisms are similar to those for ingest endpoints.

All consumption API authentication methods expect an `Authorization` header with a `Bearer` token.

### 1. JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

Secure your consumption APIs using JWTs, ideal for integration with existing identity providers or standard
token-based flows.

**Configuration:**

JWT authentication for consumption APIs uses the same `[jwt]` table in your `moose.config.toml` project file as
ingest endpoints. The `enforce_on_all_consumptions_apis` flag specifically controls JWT enforcement for consumption APIs.

```toml
# moose.config.toml

# ... other project configurations ...

[jwt]
secret = """...public key..."""
issuer = "https://my-auth-server.com/"
audience = "my-moose-app"
enforce_on_all_ingest_apis = false
# Set to true to enforce JWT on all consumption APIs.
# Defaults to false. If false, JWT is checked if configured, but an API Key can also be used.
enforce_on_all_consumptions_apis = false
```

<Callout type="info">
  Refer to the JWT section under Ingest Endpoint Authentication for details on `secret`, `issuer`, `audience`, and environment variable overrides.
</Callout>

### 2. API Key

For simpler scenarios, a static API key can protect your consumption APIs.

**Configuration:**

The primary method for configuring the consumption API key is via an environment variable.

1.  **Environment Variable (Recommended for Production):**
    Set the `MOOSE_CONSUMPTION_API_KEY` environment variable to the **hashed** API key.
    ```bash
    export MOOSE_CONSUMPTION_API_KEY=\'your_generated_hashed_key\'
    ```

<Callout type="warning">
  The `AuthenticationConfig` structure in `project.rs` does not define a specific `consumption_api_key` field for `moose.config.toml`. Therefore, relying on the `MOOSE_CONSUMPTION_API_KEY` environment variable is the recommended and standard approach.
</Callout>

Use the `moose generate hash-token` command (as described in the Ingest section) to generate the plain-text token for your clients and the hashed key for the environment variable.

<Callout type="info">
  **Priority for Consumption:** If both JWT (configured in `[jwt]`) and an API key (via `MOOSE_CONSUMPTION_API_KEY`) are configured, and `jwt.enforce_on_all_consumptions_apis` is `false` (or not set), the system attempts JWT validation first. If that fails or isn't applicable, it then tries API key validation. If `jwt.enforce_on_all_consumptions_apis` is `true`, only JWT is accepted if JWT is configured.
</Callout>

## Admin Endpoint Authentication

Administrative endpoints in Moose (e.g., for managing deployments, viewing plans) also require authentication to
prevent unauthorized access.

**Configuration:**

Admin authentication relies on a token that can be supplied in the following order of precedence:

1.  **`--token` CLI Parameter:**
    When using Moose CLI commands that interact with a remote admin endpoint (e.g., `moose remote plan --token <value>`),
    this parameter takes highest precedence. The value should be the **plain-text Bearer token**.

2.  **`MOOSE_ADMIN_TOKEN` Environment Variable:**
    You can set the `MOOSE_ADMIN_TOKEN` environment variable to the **plain-text Bearer token**.
    ```bash
    export MOOSE_ADMIN_TOKEN=\'your_generated_plain_text_token\'
    ```
    This is useful for CI/CD environments or scripts interacting with admin endpoints.

3.  **Project Configuration File (`moose.config.toml`):**
    You can specify a hashed admin API key in your `moose.config.toml` under the `authentication` table:
    ```toml
    # moose.config.toml

    [authentication]
    admin_api_key = "your_generated_hashed_key"
    ```
    The Moose server running locally will use this key to protect its admin endpoints. Use the **hashed key**
    output from `moose generate hash-token` here.

**How it Works:**
*   For CLI interactions with a remote server, the CLI will use the token from `--token` or `MOOSE_ADMIN_TOKEN`.
*   The Moose server itself (when running `moose dev` or a deployed instance) protects its admin API routes
    (e.g., `/admin/plan`, `/admin/integrate-changes`) using the `admin_api_key` from `moose.config.toml` (in the
    `[authentication]` table) or the `MOOSE_ADMIN_TOKEN` environment variable if the `moose.config.toml` key is not
    set (though `moose.config.toml` is the primary source for the server).
    The server expects the plain-text token in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header for these requests.

Use the `moose generate hash-token` command as described above to generate the plain-text token and its
corresponding hashed version for `admin_api_key`.
