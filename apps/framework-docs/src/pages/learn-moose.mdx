# Learn Moose: Building a Real-time GitHub Analytics Service

Welcome to the Moose framework tutorial! In this hands-on guide, you'll build a complete real-time analytics service that tracks and analyzes users who star your GitHub repository.

## What You'll Learn
By the end of this tutorial, you'll understand:
- The core Moose primitives and how they work together
- How to build a complete data pipeline from ingestion to insights
- Best practices for real-time data processing with Moose

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of TypeScript or Python
- A GitHub account
- Installation of Moose CLI (we'll cover this in the first step)

### Time to Complete
This tutorial takes approximately 30-60 minutes to complete.

## What You'll Build
You'll create a complete end-to-end analytics service that:
- Captures data - Ingest GitHub webhook events in real-time when users star your repository
- Processes events - Filter and enrich the raw data with additional user information
- Aggregates data - Create materialized views that aggregate information about your repository's popularity in real-time
- Exposes insights - Build APIs that expose the aggregated data to client applications

## Let's Get Started!
In the next section, we'll set up your Moose project and create your first Data Model to start ingesting sample data.
