# Ingest Data

Once you've defined a Data Model, MooseJS makes it easy to ingest source data from upstream sources
that aligns to the schema of your Data Model. There are two main ways to ingest data:

1. Pushing data to the Ingestion API Endpoint that MooseJS automatically creates for each Data Model
2. Instrumenting an upstream application using an SDK that MooseJS automatically creates for each Data Model -
   this SDK makes it easy to capture data to send to the API Endpoint automatically

## Ingesting via API Endpoints

As you define data models in your service, MooseJS will automatically generate ingestion points for you
to send data to. Ingestion points are HTTP endpoints that you can send data to. The default port is `4000`.
The standard endpoint for each data model is:

`http://localhost:4000/ingest/<DataModelName>`

Following is some example code for testing the API endpoints for a Data Model called `UserActivity`. In
the Moose developer console, when you view your Data Model, go to the `Setup` tab, and you'll find sample
code for utilizing the API Endpoints for your specific models.

  <Tabs.Tab>
    ``` bash
  curl -X POST \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"eventId": "1234567890", "timestamp": "2019-01-01 00:00:01", "userId": "123456", "activity": "click"}' \
    http://localhost:4000/ingest/UserActivity
  ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  ```javascript
  fetch('http://localhost:4000/ingest/UserActivity', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      eventId: '1234567890',
      timestamp: '2019-01-01 00:00:01',
      userId: '123456',
      activity: 'click'
    })
  })
  ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  ```python
    import requests

    requests.post('http://localhost:4000/ingest/UserActivity', json={
      'eventId': '1234567890',
      'timestamp': '2019-01-01 00:00:01',
      'userId': '123456',
      'activity': 'click'
    })
    ```

## Ingesting via MooseJS SDKs

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  We currently support Typescript SDKs. Support for other languages is coming
  soon. If you'd like to see a particular language supported, please join our
  [Slack
  community](https://join.slack.com/t/moose-community/shared_invite/zt-2fjh5n3wz-cnOmM9Xe9DYAgQrNu8xKxg)
  and let us know.
</Callout>

To facilitate the ingestion process, Moose can generate automatically a TypeScript SDK for every data model
defined in your project. The SDK provides instant type safety and schema validation, offering real-time
feedback on the data you intend to send to Moose during development.

While Moose also provides HTTP endpoints for data ingestion (see above), we recommend utilizing the SDK for
more robust data integrity enforcement and reduced runtime errors. We're actively expanding support to
include more programming languages and welcome your input on which ones to prioritize.

### Getting Started with the SDK

From within your moose project you can generate the SDK for your project by running the following command:

```txt filename="Terminal" copy
moose sdk generate
```

This will generate a new directory in your project called `sdk` that contains the SDK for your project.

You can use this command outside of a project and you can specify the directory you wish the directory to
be created in. You can use this functionality for generating the SDK in the project that will call the moose
api for example.

### Using the SDK to Send Data

To capture data with your data models, import the respective send method from your Moose SDK into your
application code. Each data model has a corresponding method that facilitates the transmission of data to
the appropriate destination table in your database. The method name follows the format `send<DATA_MODEL_NAME>`.

For example, if you're sending data for a UserActivity data model, your code snippet will look like this:

```Javascript
import sendUserActivity from "my-moose-project-name-sdk";
...
// YOUR APPLICATION CODE

// WHEREVER YOU NEED TO LOG AN EVENT
sendUserActivity({
  eventId: your_previously_defined_eventId,
  timestamp: new Date(),
  userId: your_previously_defined_userId,
  activity: "Login"
});

// REST OF YOUR CODE...
```
