# Preparing access to Clickhouse and Redpanda

Your hosted Moose application requires access to hosted Clickhouse and Redpanda service instances. You can stand up open source versions of both applications within your environments or opt to use cloud-hosted versions available at:

- [Clickhouse Cloud](https://clickhouse.com)
- [Redpanda Cloud](https://redpanda.com)

### Clickhouse

For Clickhouse, our default database, you'll need to obtain the `database name`, `user name`, `password`, `host` address, and `host port`.

### Redpanda

For Redpanda, our default streaming engine, you need the `broker` address, `user name`, `password`, `SASL_MECHANISM` (such as SCRAM-SHA-256, SCRAM-SHA-512), and the `security protocol` such as `SASL_SSL`

## Use with environment variables

You'll need the items above to use with environment variables when configuring your moose application instance on cloud providers.
