# Aggregate Programming Languages with Moose Blocks

<LanguageSwitcher />
To analyze which programming languages are most popular among your stargazers, we need to aggregate data from the `StargazerProjectInfo` table. This table contains details about each repository owned by your stargazers, but the data is spread across multiple rows and columns, making it hard to glean insights directly.

We can use Moose **Blocks** to create a **Materialized View** that pre-aggregates this data for us. This way, we can efficiently query the most popular programming languages among all stargazers.

<Callout type="info" title="What are Blocks?">
  [Blocks](/db-processing) allow you to execute SQL statements against your database to set up or manage database objects. This includes creating views or materialized views to aggregate, join, or group data from various tables.
</Callout>

## Create a New Block: `TopProgrammingLanguages`

<Steps>

### Initialize the Block with Moose CLI

In your terminal, run:

<TypeScript>
```bash filename="Terminal" copy
npx moose-cli block init TopProgrammingLanguages
```

This command generates a new file `TopProgrammingLanguages.ts` in the `/blocks` directory:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="app" open>
    <FileTree.Folder name="blocks" open>
      <FileTree.File name="TopProgrammingLanguages.ts" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>
</TypeScript>

<Python>
```bash filename="Terminal" copy
moose-cli block init TopProgrammingLanguages
```

This command generates a new file `TopProgrammingLanguages.py` in the `/blocks` directory:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="app" open>
    <FileTree.Folder name="blocks" open>
      <FileTree.File name="TopProgrammingLanguages.py" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>
</Python>

### Inspect the Generated File

Open <TypeScript NodeType="span">`TopProgrammingLanguages.ts`</TypeScript><Python NodeType="span">`TopProgrammingLanguages.py`</Python>. You should see:

<TypeScript>
```ts filename="app/blocks/TopProgrammingLanguages.ts" copy
import { Blocks } from "@514labs/moose-lib";

export default {
  setup: [
    // Array of SQL statements for setting up database resources
  ],
  teardown: [
    // Array of SQL statements for tearing down resources
  ],
} as Blocks;
```
</TypeScript>

<Python>
```py filename="app/blocks/TopProgrammingLanguages.py" copy
from moose_lib import (
    AggregationCreateOptions,
    AggregationDropOptions,
    Blocks,
    ClickHouseEngines,
    TableCreateOptions,
    create_aggregation,
    drop_aggregation,
)

teardown_queries = []

setup_queries = []

block = Blocks(teardown=teardown_queries, setup=setup_queries)
```
</Python>

<Callout type="info" title="Understanding Blocks">
- **Blocks**: Imported from <TypeScript NodeType="span"> `@514labs/moose-lib`</TypeScript><Python NodeType="span"> `moose_lib`</Python>, it provides type safety for the `setup` and `teardown` arrays.
<TypeScript>
- **Default Export**: An object conforming to the `Blocks` type.
</TypeScript>
<Python>
- **`block`**: Is an instance of the `Blocks` class.
</Python>
- **`setup`**: An array of SQL statements executed to set up database resources when you start your dev server.
- **`teardown`**: An array of SQL statements executed to clean up resources when you stop your dev server.
</Callout>

### Implement the Materialized View

We'll create a materialized view that aggregates programming language data from `StargazerProjectInfo_0_0`. This view will automatically update as new data arrives, providing real-time insights into the most popular programming languages among your stargazers.

Here's how to implement it:

<TypeScript>
```ts filename="app/blocks/TopProgrammingLanguages.ts" copy
import {
  Blocks,
  createAggregation,
  dropAggregation,
  ClickHouseEngines,
} from "@514labs/moose-lib";

const MV_NAME = "TopProgrammingLanguages_MV";
const TABLE_NAME = "TopProgrammingLanguages";

const createTableOptions = {
  name: TABLE_NAME,
  columns: {
    language: "String",
    total_projects: "AggregateFunction(count, UInt64)",
    total_repo_size_kb: "AggregateFunction(sum, Float64)",
    average_repo_size_kb: "AggregateFunction(avg, Float64)",
  },
  engine: ClickHouseEngines.AggregatingMergeTree,
  orderBy: "language",
};

const selectQuery = `
SELECT
  language,
  countState(*) AS total_projects,
  sumState(repoSizeKb) AS total_repo_size_kb,
  avgState(repoSizeKb) AS average_repo_size_kb
FROM StargazerProjectInfo_0_0
GROUP BY language
`;

export default {
  teardown: [...dropAggregation({ viewName: MV_NAME, tableName: TABLE_NAME })],
  setup: [
    ...createAggregation({
      materializedViewName: MV_NAME,
      tableCreateOptions: createTableOptions,
      select: selectQuery,
    }),
  ],
} as Blocks;
```
</TypeScript>

<Python>
```py filename="app/blocks/TopProgrammingLanguages.py" copy
from moose_lib import (
    AggregationCreateOptions,
    AggregationDropOptions,
    Blocks,
    ClickHouseEngines,
    TableCreateOptions,
    create_aggregation,
    drop_aggregation,
)


mv_name = "TopProgrammingLanguagesMV"
table_name = "TopProgrammingLanguages"

create_table_options = TableCreateOptions(
    name=table_name,
    columns={
        "language": "String",
        "total_projects": "AggregateFunction(count, Int64)",
        "total_repo_size_kb": "AggregateFunction(sum, Int64)",
        "avg_repo_size_kb": "AggregateFunction(avg, Int64)"
    },
    engine=ClickHouseEngines.AggregatingMergeTree,
    order_by="language",
)

select_query = f'''
SELECT
    language,
    countState(*) AS total_projects,
    sumState(repo_size_kb) AS total_repo_size_kb,
    avgState(repo_size_kb) AS avg_repo_size_kb
FROM
    StargazerRepositoryInfo_0_0
GROUP BY
    language
'''

teardown_queries = drop_aggregation(AggregationDropOptions(view_name=mv_name, table_name=table_name))

setup_queries = create_aggregation(AggregationCreateOptions(
    materialized_view_name=mv_name,
    select=select_query,
    table_create_options=create_table_options,
))

block = Blocks(teardown=teardown_queries, setup=setup_queries)
```
</Python>

**Explanation:**

- **Define the Aggregated Table**: We specify <TypeScript NodeType="span">`createTableOptions`</TypeScript><Python NodeType="span">`create_table_options`</Python> for the `TopProgrammingLanguages` table, which will store aggregated data such as the total number of projects and total repository size per programming language.

- **Write the Aggregation Query**: The <TypeScript NodeType="span">`selectQuery`</TypeScript><Python NodeType="span">`select_query`</Python> aggregates data from `StargazerProjectInfo_0_0`, grouping by `language` and calculating counts and sums.

- **Set Up and Tear Down**: In the <TypeScript NodeType="span">exported `Blocks` object</TypeScript><Python NodeType="span">`Blocks()` instance</Python>, we use <TypeScript NodeType="span">`createAggregation`</TypeScript><Python NodeType="span">`create_aggregation`</Python> in `setup` to establish the materialized view and table. The `teardown` uses <TypeScript NodeType="span">`dropAggregation`</TypeScript><Python NodeType="span">`drop_aggregation`</Python> to remove them when they are no longer needed.

- **AggregatingMergeTree Engine**: We use this engine for the table to optimize aggregation operations. It maintains and updates aggregation states efficiently as new data is inserted.

### Save and Apply the Changes

Save <TypeScript NodeType="span">`TopProgrammingLanguages.ts`</TypeScript><Python NodeType="span">`TopProgrammingLanguages.py`</Python>. Moose will automatically apply the changes, creating the new table and materialized view in your database.

### Verify the Materialized View

Open your ClickHouse database explorer and check that the `TopProgrammingLanguages` table and `TopProgrammingLanguages_MV` materialized view have been created. Query the `TopProgrammingLanguages` table to see the aggregated data:

```sql
SELECT
  language,
  countMerge(total_projects) AS total_projects,
  sumMerge(total_repo_size_kb) AS total_repo_size_kb,
  avgMerge(average_repo_size_kb) AS average_repo_size_kb
FROM TopProgrammingLanguages
ORDER BY total_projects DESC
```

<Callout type="info" title="Understanding the Query">
In AggregatingMergeTree tables, `countState` and `sumState` store intermediate states (partial counts or sums). To get final results, `countMerge` and `sumMerge` combine these states into total counts or sums.
</Callout>

</Steps>

<Callout type="success">
  You've successfully aggregated programming language data! To recap:
  - You initialized a new Block using the Moose CLI helper.
  - You implemented a materialized view that aggregates data from `StargazerProjectInfo_0_0`.
  - The setup automates the creation of the view and table, and Moose manages the execution of these SQL statements.

  Your data is now pre-aggregated and ready for analysis or integration into applications.
