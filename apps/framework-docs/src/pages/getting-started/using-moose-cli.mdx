# CLI Commands

MooseJS provides a CLI to help you build your data-intensive app or service. The CLI is automatically installed when you first intall MooseJS.

## Init

Initializes the developer environment with all the necessary directories including temporary ones for data storage.

```txt filename="Terminal" copy
moose init --name <name> --language <language> --location <location>
```

- `--name <name>`: Name of your app or service.
- `--language <language>`: Language of your app or service. We currently only support `Typescript`.
- `--location <location>`: Location of your app or service. Default is the current directory (`.`).

## Dev

Starts a local development environment to build your data-intensive app or service. This also spins up the local infrastructure for your application including a local database and a local message broker.

```txt filename="Terminal" copy
moose dev
```

## Clean

Clears all temporary data and stops development infrastructure.

```txt filename="Terminal" copy
moose clean
```
