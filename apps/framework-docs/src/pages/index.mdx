## What is Moose JS?
MooseJS is a JavaScript/Typescript framework for building data-intensive applications and services. It's designed to be intuitive and scalable for software engineers who do not have a background in data engineering. You can combine MooseJS and your favorite frontend framework to build feature-rich, interactive data applications for your users and stakeholders.

MooseJS is designed to be a batteries-included framework that helps you build your application without having to worry about the underlying data infrastructure. Under the hood, it's built with a Rust based core that helps you package, build and deploy your application to reliably take your apps from your local machine to production.
