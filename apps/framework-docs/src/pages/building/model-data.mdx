# Model Data
MooseJS's data modeling is built on top of Prisma's intuitive schema modeling language. You can read more about Prisma's schema modeling language [here](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema). To get started you simply need to create a `.prisma` file in your project's data model directory. If you're in [development mode](https://docs.moosejs.com/getting-started/dev-mode), MooseJS will automatically detect this file and use it to generate:
- A typed data capture SDK to instrument your application
- A high-performance ingestion server to receive data from your application
- A buffer to store data as it's ingested from the ingestion server
- An ingestion table and an analytics view to store and query your data

## Creating a Model
```prisma filename="datamodels/models.prisma" copy
model UserActivity {
    eventId     String @id
    timestamp   DateTime
    userId      String
    activityType String
}
```

As you can see, the data model is very simple. It's just a list of fields and their types. MooseJS will automatically generate a table for you in your database and a view to query your data. We don't currently support all of Prisma's schema modeling features, but we're working on it. If you'd like to see a feature added, please join our [Slack community](https://join.slack.com/t/moose-community/shared_invite/zt-2fjh5n3wz-cnOmM9Xe9DYAgQrNu8xKxg) and let us know.

## Inspecting Your Model
Once you've created your model, you can inspect it along with the infrastructure that MooseJS automatically generated for you by navigating to the console at http://localhost:3001.

## Test Your Model
When you create a model, MooseJS automatically creates an ingestion point to facilitate immediate data testing. Send a sample payload to this endpoint using:

<Tabs items={['Single Data Sample', 'Batch Sample']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  ``` bash
  curl -X POST \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"eventId": "1234567890", "timestamp": "2019-01-01 00:00:01", "userId": "123456", "activityType":"click"}' \
    http://localhost:4000/ingest/UserActivity
  ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  ``` bash
  for i in {1..10}
  do
    curl -X POST \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"eventId": "$i", "timestamp": "2024-01-01 00:00:00", "userId": "1234", "activityType":"click"}' \
      http://localhost:4000/ingest/UserActivity
  done
  ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

## Next steps
You're set to start sending data into your Moose application from upstream sources. Detailed integration steps are available in the [next section](/building/capture-data).
To understand the impact of changes to your data model, refer to the [Make Changes](/building/make-changes) section of the docs.
