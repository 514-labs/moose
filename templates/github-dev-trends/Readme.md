This template provides a real-time dashboard tracking trending repositories and topics on GitHub. It collects and analyzes Star Events from the public GitHub events feed using Moose for the backend and a separate dashboard application for the frontend.

**Language:** TypeScript (Backend - Moose), JavaScript/TypeScript (Frontend - Next.js)
**Stack:** Moose, Node.js, Kafka, ClickHouse, Next.js/React (Frontend)
**Package Manager:** pnpm (Monorepo)

**Documentation:** [Template Documentation](https://docs.fiveonefour.com/templates/github)

## Prerequisites

*   Node.js (Minimum version 20+)
*   pnpm (Minimum version 8+)
*   Moose CLI
*   Docker Desktop (For underlying services like Kafka/ClickHouse if used by `moose dev`)

## Project Structure

This is a pnpm monorepo with the following structure:

```
.
├── apps/
│   ├── dashboard/        # Next.js dashboard application
│   └── moose-backend/    # Moose backend service (TypeScript)
├── packages/
│   └── moose-objects/    # Pure Moose objects, imported by both apps
├── package.json          # Root package.json with workspace scripts
├── pnpm-workspace.yaml   # pnpm workspace configuration
├── Readme.md             # This file
└── template.config.toml  # Template specific configuration
```

## Setup

If you haven't already, install the Moose CLI and pnpm:
```bash copy
# Install Moose CLI
bash -i <(curl -fsSL https://fiveonefour.com/install.sh) moose

# Install pnpm if not already installed
npm install -g pnpm
```

### 1. Initialize the Project
```bash copy
moose init moose-github-dev-trends github-dev-trends
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash copy
cd moose-github-dev-trends
pnpm install
```

### 3. Moose Backend Setup

*   Set the GitHub Personal Access Token:
    *   This project requires a [GitHub Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic) to access the GitHub API for fetching event data.
    *   Set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable in your `.env.example` file to your GitHub token.
* Start your Moose local dev server:
    ```bash copy
    pnpm moose:dev
    ```
    *   This will start the Moose backend service containing the local infrastructure (Redpanda, ClickHouse, Temporal, Webserver) and the GitHub event poller.
    *   You can verify that it's running by checking the Moose logs in your terminal.

### 4. Frontend Dashboard Setup

*   Open a **new terminal** and start the frontend dashboard:
    ```bash copy
    pnpm dashboard:dev
    ```
    *   Navigate to the URL provided (usually `http://localhost:3000`) in your browser to view the dashboard.

## Available Scripts

From the root directory, you can run:

- `pnpm dev` - Start both dashboard and moose-backend in development mode
- `pnpm build` - Build both applications
- `pnpm dashboard:dev` - Start only the dashboard in development mode
- `pnpm dashboard:build` - Build only the dashboard
- `pnpm moose:dev` - Start only the moose-backend in development mode
- `pnpm moose:build` - Build only the moose-backend

## Deployment

Deploying this project involves deploying the Moose backend service and the frontend dashboard separately.

**Prerequisites:**

*   A GitHub account and your project code pushed to a GitHub repository.
*   A [Boreal](https://boreal.cloud/signup) account for the backend.
*   A [Vercel](https://vercel.com/signup) account (or similar platform) for the frontend.

### 1. Deploying the Moose Backend (Boreal)

*   **Push to GitHub:** Ensure your latest backend code (the contents of the `apps/moose-backend` directory) is committed and pushed to your GitHub repository.
*   **Create Boreal Project:**
    *   Log in to your Boreal account and create a new project.
    *   Connect Boreal to your GitHub account and select the repository containing your project.
    *   Configure the project settings, ensuring Boreal points to the `apps/moose-backend` directory if your repository root contains the monorepo structure.
*   **Configure Environment Variables:**
    *   In the Boreal project settings, add the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable with your GitHub Personal Access Token as the value.
*   **Deploy:** Boreal should automatically build and deploy your Moose service based on your repository configuration. It will also typically start any polling sources (like the GitHub event poller) defined in your `moose.config.toml`.
*   **Note API URL:** Once deployed, Boreal will provide a public URL for your Moose backend API. You will need this for the frontend deployment.

### 2. Deploying the Frontend Dashboard (Vercel)

*   **Push to GitHub:** Ensure your latest frontend code (the contents of the `apps/dashboard` directory) is committed and pushed to your GitHub repository.
*   **Create Vercel Project:**
    *   Log in to your Vercel account and create a new project.
    *   Connect Vercel to your GitHub account and select the repository containing your project.
*   **Configure Project Settings:**
    *   Set the **Root Directory** in Vercel to `apps/dashboard` (or wherever your frontend code resides within the repository).
    *   Vercel should automatically detect it's a Next.js project and configure the build command (`pnpm build`) and output directory correctly. Adjust if necessary.
*   **Configure Environment Variables:**
    *   This is crucial: The frontend needs to know where the deployed backend API is located.
    *   Add an environment variable in Vercel to point to your Boreal API URL. The variable name depends on how the frontend code expects it (e.g., `NEXT_PUBLIC_MOOSE_URL`). Check the frontend code (`apps/dashboard/`) for the exact variable name.
        ```
        # Example Vercel Environment Variable
        NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-boreal-project-url.boreal.cloud
        ```
*   **Deploy:** Vercel will build and deploy your Next.js frontend.

Once both backend and frontend are deployed and configured correctly, your live GitHub Trends Dashboard should be accessible via the Vercel deployment URL.
