# Setting up Multiple Versions of a Data Model

The following guide will demonstrate how to create a new version of a Data Model in a Moose project and how to generate a migration function to migrate data from the old version to the new version.

Recall from the [Data Change Management Core Concepts](/data-models/dcm#core-concepts) that Moose supports operating multiple versions of a Data Model in parallel, so that when you make a change to a Data Model, you can continue to operate on the old version of the Data Model while the new version is being ingested and migrated.

Additionally, recall that the state of your files in your git repository of your Moose application corresponds to the latest version of your data model.

<Callout
  type="info"
  title="Prerequisites: Have a Moose project with a Data Model"
>
  If you don't have a Moose project with a Data Model, follow the [Quick Start
  guide](/quickstart) to create a new Moose project for this guide.
</Callout>

## Change a Data Model

Select a Data Model in your `datamodels` folder and make a change to one of the fields. This can be a change in the type of the field, or a change in the name of the field. It can also be removing a field and adding a new field with a different name or type.

<Callout type="warning" title="Stop your Dev Server ">
  If you have a dev server running, stop it (`CTRL+C` in the terminal) before
  proceeding.
</Callout>

### Example: Defining a new version of the `UserActivity` Data Model

In the boilerplate project created in the [Quick Start guide](/quickstart), the `UserActivity` Data Model is defined as follows:

```ts filename="./app/datamodels/models.ts"
export interface UserActivity {
  eventId: Key<string>;
  userId: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  activity: string;
}
```

To change the `UserActivity` Data Model and generate a new version of it, we will delete the `activity` field. The new version of the Data Model will be as follows:

```ts filename="./app/datamodels/models.ts"
export interface UserActivity {
  eventId: Key<string>;
  userId: string;
  timestamp: Date;
}
```

## Bumping the Version of the Data Model

Run the following command to bump the version of the Data Model:

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
npx moose-cli bump-version
```

<Callout type="info" title="Bumping the version">
This command will bump the version in your `package.json` file and add a pointer between the git commit and the previous version to the `moose.config.toml` file.

```toml filename="./moose.config.toml"
[supported_old_versions]
"0.0" = "263297f"
```

</Callout>

## Generate the Continuous Migration Function

Run the following command:

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
npx moose-cli generate migrations
```

<Tabs items={["Streaming Function", "SQL Mapping File"]}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  ### Streaming Function Migration
This command will generate a special **migration** Streaming Function in the `/functions` directory.

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="app" open>
    <FileTree.Folder name="datamodels" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="functions" open>
      <FileTree.File name="UserActivity_migrate__0_0__0_1.ts" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

Inside this file, you will see the following:

```ts filename="./app/functions/UserActivity_migrate__0_0__0_1.ts" copy
export default function migrate(event: UserActivity_0_0): UserActivity_0_1 {
  return {
    eventId: event.eventId,
    timestamp: event.timestamp,
    userId: event.userId,
  };
}
```

The setup of this function looks like a regular [Streaming Function](/processing-data):

- The old version (`UserActivity_0_0`) is the input type.
- The new version (`UserActivity_0_1`) is the output type.
- The function body is the migration logic.

<Callout type="info" title="Migrations are a Special Type of Streaming Function">
<br/><br/>
Migration functions are unique because they are initially executed on all the data in the table for the previous version. This is the **Initial Data Load** part of the migration.
<br/><br/>
Like regular Streaming Functions, this migration function will be executed for any new data that is ingested into the old Data Model version in order to migrate it to the new version. This is the **Continuous** part of the migration.
</Callout>
</Tabs.Tab>

<Tabs.Tab>
### SQL Mapping File
This command will generate a SQL mapping file in the functions directory:

```sql filename="./app/functions/UserActivity_migrate__0_0__0_1.sql"
(eventId, timestamp, userId, activity) -> (eventId, timestamp, userId)
```

This is a [SQL fragment](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/functions)
that gets embedded into two other queries:

1. Create a trigger that continuously copies data from the older version
   to the newer version.
2. Perform an initial loads of the data from the older version of the table to the newer
   version of the table.

<Callout type="warning" title="SQL Mapping File">
  The SQL mapping file represents Moose's best guess at the migration path
  between versions, but please feel free to edit the SQL mapping file to specify
  particular mapping, typing, etc.
</Callout>

</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

## Inspect the Resulting State

First start your dev server:

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
npx moose-cli dev
```

Next, open a new terminal window and run the following command:

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
npx moose-cli ls
```

Here you will be able to see the additional tables automatically created for
you: `UserActivity_0_1` is one of them.

<Callout type="info" title="Not working with the UserActivity Data Model?">
  If you are following this guide with a different Data Model in your own
  project, you should see `YOUR_DATA_MODEL_NAME_0_1` in the list of tables.
</Callout>

Run the following in your terminal to send some data to version `_0_0` of your data model

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
curl -v -X POST \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{\"eventId\": \"1\", \"timestamp\": \"$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')\", \"userId\": \"1\", \"activity\": \"click\"}" \
    http://localhost:4000/ingest/UserActivity/0.0
```

You will notice that it contains the activity field that we deleted.

### Query the Data Model

In your DB explorer, execute the following query:

```sql filename="Your Database Explorer" copy
SELECT * FROM local.UserActivity_0_0 LIMIT 50;
```

You should see the event we just added there.

### Validate the Continuous Migration Output

The continuous migration working behind the scenes will allow you to also see the data
inside `local.UserActivity_0_1`:

```sql filename="Your Database Explorer" copy
SELECT * FROM local.UserActivity_0_1 LIMIT 50;
```

This should return the same record, but without the `activity`
column.

<Callout type="success" title="Success!">
  The data was automatically migrated to the new table. This is a trivial
  example, but the same feature holds true for more complex migrations.
</Callout>

### Sending Data to the New Data Model Version

Run the following `curl` command to send sample data to the new version of the `UserActivity` Data Model (`UserActivity_0_1`):

```txt filename="Terminal" copy
curl -v -X POST \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{\"eventId\": \"2\", \"timestamp\": \"$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')\", \"userId\": \"2\"}" \
    http://localhost:4000/ingest/UserActivity/0.1
```

<Callout type="info" title="Data Shows up in the 0_1 table only!">
  This setup enables you to keep old models alive with historical data as you
  migrate your infrastructure to produce and consume data on the new data model.
  <br />
  <br />
  Once all your data is migrated, you can remove the old version, and we will appropriately
  clean up the infrastructure.
</Callout>

To summarize:

- Data Change Management allows you to version your data infrastructure alongside your Data Models.
- As you update your Data Models, Moose will automate the creation of data infrastructure, and allow you to run the
  old data infrastructure alongside the new data infrastructure, keeping the old data
  flowing through to the new Data Models with migrations.
- Such migrations are defined by Moose, but you may change the definition as per your requirements.
- This allows you to treat your data infrastructure and your Data Models as you do your code.
