# Install

Requirements:

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en)

```
bash -i <(curl -fsSL https://fiveonefour.com/install.sh) aurora,moose
```

This will install Moose (our open source developer framework for Data Engineering) and Aurora.

## New projects

Create a new project with

```
aurora init
```

You can create a new project from scratch

```
aurora init <new-project> typescript-empty
```

Or from an existing template (see template section below).

```
aurora init <new-project> <template-name>
```

You can optionally specify which host you would like to use, it defaults to Cursor's project level configuration (e.g. to Cursor with a Global config). See Host setup guide below. See CLI reference below.

```
aurora init <new-project> <template-name> --mcp cursor-global
```

Using templates is the fastest way to get up and running, as they are fully fledged data engineering projects ingesting data at scale, that you can interact with using Aurora.

## Existing projects

Navigate into the root directory of your Moose project, you'll know it is the correct directory because it contains a `moose-config.toml` file.

Then, point aurora at it with:

```
aurora setup
```

You can optionally specify which host you would like to use, it defaults to Cursor's project level configuration.

```
aurora setup --mcp claude-desktop
```

```
aurora setup --mcp cursor-global
```

```
aurora setup --mcp cursor-project
```

See Host setup guide below. See CLI reference below.
