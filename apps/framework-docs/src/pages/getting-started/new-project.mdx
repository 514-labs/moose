# Requirements
You will need the following dependencies installed on your machine before you can use MooseJS:
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- macOS or Linux (Windows is not supported at this time)

## Quick Start

The easiest way to get started with a new MooseJS application is to use `create-moose-app`. This will automatically create a project folder for you, and initialize a skeleton MooseJS app with the entire project structure you need to get started.
```txt filename="Terminal" copy
npx create-moose-app my-app
```
