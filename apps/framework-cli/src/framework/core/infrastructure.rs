//! Infrastructure module for framework core components.
//!
//! This module defines the core infrastructure components used throughout the framework,
//! providing abstractions for various data storage, processing, and communication mechanisms.
//! It establishes a consistent pattern for defining infrastructure components and their
//! relationships through data lineage.
//!
//! This is a platform agnostic module that can be used to define infrastructure components
//! for any platform. ie there should not be anything specific to a given warehouse or streaming engine
//! in this module.
//!
//! The infrastructure components are used to build the infrastructure map which is used to
//! generate the deployment plan.
//!
//! If components need to reference each other, they should do so by reference and not by value.
