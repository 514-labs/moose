description: Minimum Requirements for Moose
---

## Development Setup

The development setup has higher requirements because Moose runs locally along with all its dependencies (Redpanda, ClickHouse, Temporal, Redis).

-   **CPU:** 12 cores
-   **Memory:** 18GB
-   **Disk:** >500GB SSD
-   **OS:**
    -   Windows with Linux subsystem (Ubuntu preferred)
    -   Linux (Debian 10+, Ubuntu 18.10+, Fedora 29+, CentOS/RHEL 8+)
    -   Mac OS 13+
-   **Runtime:** Python 3.12+ or Node.js 20+, Docker 24.0.0+, and Docker Compose 2.23.1+

## Production Setup

The production setup has lower requirements, as external components (Redpanda, ClickHouse, Redis, and Temporal) are assumed to be deployed separately.

-   **CPU:** 1vCPU
-   **Memory:** 6GB
-   **Disk:** >30GB SSD
-   **OS:**
    -   Windows with Linux subsystem (Ubuntu preferred)
    -   Linux (Debian 10+, Ubuntu 18.10+, Fedora 29+, CentOS/RHEL 8+)
    -   Mac OS 13+
-   **Runtime:** Python 3.12+ or Node.js 20+
