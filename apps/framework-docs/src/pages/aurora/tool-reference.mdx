- `write_spec`
    - Generate or update a specification for a data-intensive feature.
- `write_workflow`
    - Write a script for use in Moose Workflows.
- `write_data_model`

## Boreal Experimental Tools

> Note, these are experimental tools, if you want to use them, toggle the experimental features flag with `aurora config tools experimental`

- `read_production_clickhouse`
    - Read your Boreal ClickHouse database. In this iteration, requires manually inputting certain fields into `mcp.json`: `BOREAL_CLICKHOUSE_HOST`, `BOREAL_CLICKHOUSE_PORT`, `BOREAL_CLICKHOUSE_USER`, `BOREAL_CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD`, `BOREAL_CLICKHOUSE_DATABASE`. Whilst the tool is read only, we suggest furnishing the MCP with read-only credentials in an abundance of caution.
