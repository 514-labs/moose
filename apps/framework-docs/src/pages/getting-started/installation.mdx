# Installation
You will need the following dependencies installed on your machine before you can use MooseJS:
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- macOS or Linux (Windows is not supported at this time)

## Quick Start

The easiest way to install MooseJS is to use the NPX command. This will download the latest version of MooseJS and run the initialization command for your project.
```bash filename="Terminal" copy
npm create-moosejs-app my-app
```

## Manual Installation

If you'd like more flexibility, you can also also install MooseJS globally using NPM. This will allow you to run the MooseJS CLI from anywhere on your machine and initialize new projects.

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
npm install -g @514-labs/moosejs
```
