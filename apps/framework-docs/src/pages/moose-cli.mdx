# Installation

MooseJS comes with a handy CLI for managing your MooseJS application. Navigate to your project's directory to run commands. There are a few ways to run the CLI:

<Tabs items={['No Install', 'Project-level Install', 'Global Install']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    The simplest method to run the CLI is via NPX. No extra installation is necessary for this method.
    ```txt filename="Terminal" copy
    $ npx @514labs/moose-cli <command>
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    Alternatively, the Moose CLI comes packaged with your Moose application. You can install the dependency locally and then run the Moose CLI within your project with:
    ```txt filename="Terminal" copy
    $ npm install
    $ npm run moose <command> 
    // or 
    $ npx moose-cli <command>
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    Finally, you can install the Moose CLI globally using NPM. This will get you a cleaner command interface, and better performance on the CLI. You can then run the Moose CLI anywhere.  
    ```txt filename="Terminal" copy
    $ npm install -g @514labs/moose-cli
    $ moose <command>
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

# Moose CLI commands

### Init

Instead of using `create-moose-app`, you can initialize your project manually with the CLI, if you'd like more flexibility and control. Either option will initialize a new MooseJS project for you, with all the necessary directories including temporary ones for data storage.

```txt filename="Terminal" copy
moose init <name> --language <language> <--location <location>> <--no-fail-already-exists>
```

- `<name>`: Name of your app or service.
- `--language <language>`: Language of your app or service. We currently only support `Typescript`.
- `--location <location>`: Location of your app or service. The default is the name of the project.
- `--no-fail-already-exists`: By default, the init command fails if `location` exists, to prevent accidental reruns. This flag disables the check.

### Build

Builds your moose project. Syncs model changes, performs cleanup and prepares your project for use and deployment.

When the `--docker` flag is used, the Moose build command also packages your project into local Docker containers.

```txt filename="Terminal" copy
moose build <--docker>
```

### Dev

Starts a development environment running the full stack of your MooseJS application locally. As you develop your MooseJS application locally, changes you make to your codebase will be automatically reflected here in real-time (when you save changes).

```txt filename="Terminal" copy
moose dev
```

### Prod

Starts Moose in production mode. This command is automatically invoked from a packaged Moose Docker container.

```txt filename="Terminal" copy
moose prod
```

### Flow

#### Flow Init

Generates a new Flow for you, including creating and structuring the necessary directories and files based on your specified data models. Learn more in the [Flows docs](../building/flows/setup).

```txt filename="Terminal" copy
moose flow init --source <YourSourceDataModel> --destination <YourDestinationDataModel>
```

### Generate

#### Generate SDK

Generates an ingest sdk for the specified project.

```txt filename="Terminal" copy
moose generate sdk -l <Language> -d <Directory> -p <ProjectLocation>
```

- `-l, --language`: Language of the SDK. We currently only support `Typescript`.
- `-d, --destination`: Directory to generate the SDK in.
- `-p, --project`: Location of the project to generate the SDK for.
- `-f, --full-package`: Whether or not to generate a full fledged package or just the source files in the language of choice.

#### Generate Migrations

Generates migration scripts for models that are different from the previous version. Learn more in the [Data Change Management docs](../building/dcm/intro).

```txt filename="Terminal" copy
moose generate migrations
```

### Bump Version

Bumps the `version` field in `package.json`, and adds an entry of the current version and commit hash to `[supported_old_versions]` section in `project.toml`. Learn more in the [Data Change Management docs](../building/dcm/intro).

```txt filename="Terminal" copy
moose bump-version <new_version>
```

- `<new_version>`: optional parameter, if omitted, moose will default to bumping the minor version.

### Clean

Clears all temporary data and stops development infrastructure.

```txt filename="Terminal" copy
moose clean
```

### Logs

View logs to help debug how data moves through Moose.

```txt filename="Terminal" copy
moose logs <--tail> <--filter <search_string>>
```

### Processes

View processes created by Moose, such as its underlying streaming platform & database with local access credentials.

```txt filename="Terminal" copy
moose ps
```

### List

View Moose primitives & infrastructure.

```txt filename="Terminal" copy
moose ls -v <version> -l <limit>
```

- `-v, --version`: View a specific version. Defaults to latest version.
- `-l, --limit`: Limit output to a specific number of data models. Defaults to 10.
