# Deploying on Amazon ECS

Moose can be deployed to Amazon's Elastic Container Service (ECS). ECS offers a managed container orchestrator at a fraction of the complexity of managing a Kubernetes cluster.
The first step is deciding whether you'll host your moose container on Docker Hub or Amazon's Elastic Container Registry (ECR).

Amazon ECR is straightforward and is designed to work out of the box with ECS.
Using Docker Hub works just fine if your moose container is publicly available; however, if your container is private, you'll need to do a bit more work to provide ECS with your Docker credentials.

Here is an overview of the steps required:

- You'll first need to create or use an existing ECS cluster.
- Next, you'll need to create an ECS `Task definition.` This is where you'll specify whether you want to use AWS Fargate or AWS EC2 instances. You'll also have options for selecting your OS and Architecture. Specify `Linux/X86-64` or `Linux/ARM-64`. This is important as you'll also need to specify a matching moose container image, such as `moose-df-deployment-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu:0.3.175` or `moose-df-deployment-aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu:0.3.175`
- As with all AWS services, if you're using secrets to store credentials, you'll need to specify an IAM role with an `AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy` and `SecretsManagerReadWrite` policy.
- Under the Container section, specify the name of your moose deployment and provide the container image name you're using.
- Next, specify the Container Port as 4000.

In the next section below, choose `Amazon ECS` to view instructions for configuring your container environment variables.

## Configuring container environment variables

While still in the Amazon ECS Task definition section, you'll need to provide the environment variables on which your Moose application depends.
Scroll down to the Environment variables section and fill in each of the following variables.

> Note that if you prefer, you can provide the environment variables below via an env file hosted on S3.

| Moose Server Keys                | Usage                                                              |

Consider other options on the Task creation page and press the `Create` button when ready.

## Building an ECS Service

Once you've completed creating an ECS Task, you're ready to create an ECS Service. An ECS Service is a definition that allows you to specify how your cluster will be managed.
Navigate to your cluster's Service page and press the `Create` button to create your new moose service.
The section we're interested in is the `Deployment configuration` section. There, you'll specify the Task Definition you created earlier. You can also specify the name of your service—perhaps something creative like `moose-service`—and the number of tasks to launch.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="ℹ️">
  Note at this time, we recommend that you only launch a single instance of
  moose in your cluster. We're currently developing for multi-instance
  concurrent usage.
</Callout>

The remaining sections on the create service page allow you to specify networking considerations and whether you'll use a load balancer.

You can press the `Create` button to launch an instance of your new ECS Moose service.

### Setting up a health check

Your generated moose docker containers feature an internal HEALTHCHECK:

```docker copy
  # Setup healthcheck
  HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s \
    CMD curl -f http://localhost:4000/health || exit 1
```

You'll need to use that health check endpoint when setting up your ECS service load balancer.  
Simply specify the `/health` endpoint.
