# Introduction
Welcome to the MooseJS documentation! MooseJS is still in early development, and we're talking to users and potential users all the time to make sure we're creating something valuable. If you're at all interested in what we're building here, then we'd love to talk to you! Please join our [Slack community](https://join.slack.com/t/igloocommunity/shared_invite/zt-25gsnx2x2-9ttVTt4L9LYFrRcM6jimcg) and reach out. We can't wait to hear from you!

## What is MooseJS?
MooseJS is a JavaScript/Typescript framework for building data-intensive applications and services. It's designed to be intuitive and scalable for software engineers who do not have a background in data engineering. You can combine MooseJS and your favorite frontend framework to build feature-rich, interactive data applications for your users and stakeholders.

MooseJS is designed to be a batteries-included framework that helps you build your application without having to worry about the underlying data infrastructure. Under the hood, it's built with a Rust based core that helps you package, build and deploy your application to reliably take your apps from your local machine to production.
