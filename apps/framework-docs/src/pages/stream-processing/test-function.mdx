# Testing Streaming Functions

## 1. Send Test Data to Source Data Model

Ingest test data into the source data model to trigger the function.

  Data](../data-models/capture-data) section of the documentation.

## 2. Check CLI Output Check the terminal output to see if the streaming function
has processed the data correctly. You should see the following message in your terminal:

```txt
Received SourceDataModel -> DestinationDataModel 1 message(s)
```

<Callout>
  Don't see this message? Here are some troubleshooting tips: - Make sure you
  have the correct source and destination data models in your function file. -
  Save the function file after making changes. - Double check your function
  logic for any errors. You can also run `moose logs --tail` to see logs in
  real-time.

## 3. Inspect Destination Data Model Table

After the streaming function processes the data, check the destination table in the database to see if the data has been transformed correctly.
