# Introduction

Sometimes, the data you get isn’t exactly the way you want it. So you have to
process the data to fit the form you need. In Moose, you do this by creating a Streaming Function that connects one data model to another. Streaming Functions consist of:

- a source data model
- a destination data model
- a function that processes the data from the source to fit the destination.

## File Structure

When you create a Moose app, you will have a `/functions` directory in your app folder. This directory contains all the streaming functions you create. Each streaming function is a TypeScript (`.ts`) file that defines how data is transformed from the source data model to the destination data model. The file name should be in the format `SourceDataModel__DestinationDataModel.ts`.

<Callout>
  This file structure is important because Moose uses it to automatically
  identify and execute the streaming functions you create. Make sure you use two
  underscores to separate the source and destination data models in the file
  name.

## Function Definition

The function definition should have the following structure:

```ts filename="/functions/SourceDataModel__DestinationDataModel.ts" copy
export default function functionName(
  source: SourceDataModel,
): DestinationDataModel[] | DestinationDataModel | null {
  // Transformation logic
}
```

Creating a streaming function in Moose is easy: you write a TypeScript function
that defines how data needs to be transformed. Moose’s will automatically
apply these transformations whenever data hits the source data model that the streaming function
is associated with.

Each streaming function essentially has three components: the source and destination data
models (which are represented in the structure of the `/functions` directory), and
the TypeScript definition of how to manipulate the data from the source to fit
the requirements of the destination.

You define the start, the end, and the path, Moose’s infrastructure automates
the rest.
