# Monitoring & Observability

Learn how to monitor your Moose application and gain insights into its performance and health.

## Monitoring Overview

Moose provides built-in monitoring capabilities for all components:

- **Metrics**: Quantitative measurements of your application
- **Logs**: Detailed event records 
- **Traces**: Request flows through your application

## Metrics Console

Moose includes a built-in metrics console that provides real-time visibility into your application:

```bash
# Start the metrics console
moose metrics
```

This opens the a terminal UI application with charts for:

- Ingestion rates
- Stream processing latency
- API response times
- Database query performance

## Key Metrics

### Ingestion Metrics

| Metric | Description | Alert Threshold |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| `ingestion.requests.count` | Total ingestion requests | - |
| `ingestion.requests.rate` | Requests per second | >500/s |
| `ingestion.error.rate` | Failed ingestion requests | >1% |
| `ingestion.latency` | Request processing time | >200ms p95 |

### Stream Processing Metrics

| Metric | Description | Alert Threshold |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| `stream.records.count` | Total records processed | - |
| `stream.processing.rate` | Records per second | - |
| `stream.lag` | Processing delay | >5s |
| `stream.errors` | Processing errors | >0 |

### Database Metrics

| Metric | Description | Alert Threshold |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| `db.query.count` | Total queries executed | - |
| `db.query.latency` | Query execution time | >500ms |
| `db.write.rate` | Records written per second | - |
| `db.error.rate` | Database errors | >0 |

## Log Collection

Moose logs are structured for easy analysis:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2023-03-28T14:32:11.342Z",
  "level": "info",
  "service": "ingest-api",
  "message": "Processed event batch",
  "details": {
    "batchId": "batch-123",
    "recordCount": 52,
    "processingTimeMs": 120
  }
}
```

### Log Levels

- **ERROR**: Application errors requiring attention
- **WARN**: Potential issues or degraded performance
- **INFO**: Normal operations and key events


## Integration with External Tools
 
 Coming soon.
