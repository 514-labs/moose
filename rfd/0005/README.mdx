title: Moose CLI Version Management
state: prediscussion
---

## Objective

We propose a new version management system for the Moose CLI that ensures compatibility between the CLI and its associated
language-specific libraries (moose-libs). The goal is to create a transparent version management experience where the correct 
CLI version is automatically used based on project requirements, eliminating version mismatch issues between the CLI and libraries.

## Scope

This RFD focuses specifically on the Moose CLI version management system. The following are explicitly out of scope:

- Language-specific libraries (moose-libs):
  - These are managed through their respective language package managers (npm, pip, etc.)
  - Installation and versioning handled by the project's dependency management system
  - Libraries are project-local and not directly called by users
  - Version compatibility is enforced through dependency specifications in package.json/requirements.txt

## Version Selection Rules

The system follows these rules for selecting which version of the CLI to use:

1. Inside a Moose Project:
   - Use the version specified in the project's lock file (package-lock.json, yarn.lock, etc.) then fallsback to the package.json or requirements.txt.
   - This ensures compatibility between CLI and project libraries

2. Outside a Moose Project:
   - Always use the latest installed version
   - This applies to commands like `moose init` for creating new projects
   - New projects will be initialized with this latest installed version

## User Benefit

Users will benefit from:
- Automatic version management that eliminates CLI-library version mismatches
- Seamless installation of required CLI versions based on project needs
- No manual intervention needed to switch between different versions of Moose for different projects
- Consistent behavior across projects with different version requirements
- Reduced debugging time by eliminating version-related issues
- Standardized installation process across multiple programming languages
- Simplified upgrade path through package manifest updates
- Latest version always available for new project creation

## Design Proposal

### Overview

The proposed system consists of three main components:

1. A version-aware wrapper script (installed as `moose`)
2. A local version cache manager
3. A remote version installer

Key design principles:
- Unlike NVM, versions are automatically selected based on project configuration
- Moose CLI only operates within Moose projects
- Latest installed version is used outside of project contexts (e.g., for `moose init`)
- Single installation method (curl-based) works across all supported languages
- Standardized installation location for simplified support
- Maintains existing behavior for Aurora CLI installation
- Libraries managed separately through language-specific package managers

### Installation Script Behavior

The installation script will handle two distinct installation patterns:

#### Aurora CLI Installation
- Maintains current direct installation behavior
- Single version installation
- No version management wrapper
- Preserves existing update mechanisms

#### Moose CLI Installation
- Installs version management wrapper
- Supports multiple versions
- Automatic version selection based on project
- Local version caching
- Does not manage language-specific libraries
- Always installs latest version initially for new project creation

The script will detect which CLI is being installed and apply the appropriate installation pattern:

```bash
# Aurora - direct installation (unchanged behavior)
bash -i <(curl -sSL https://www.fiveonefour.com/install.sh) aurora

# Moose - new version management behavior
bash -i <(curl -sSL https://www.fiveonefour.com/install.sh) moose

# Installing both at the same time
bash -i <(curl -sSL https://www.fiveonefour.com/install.sh) aurora,moose

# Installing a specific version
bash -i <(curl -sSL https://www.fiveonefour.com/install.sh) moose@1.0.0,aurora@1.0.0

# Specifying a channel
RELEASE_CHANNEL=dev bash -i <(curl -sSL https://www.fiveonefour.com/install.sh) moose
```

### Implementation Details

#### Version Detection

The wrapper script will:
1. Check if current directory is within a Moose project:
   - If yes, look for version information in:
     - `package.json` for TypeScript projects (moose-libs version specified in dependencies)
     - `pyproject.toml`/`requirements.txt` for Python projects (moose-libs version specified in dependencies)
   - If no, use latest installed version
2. For project contexts:
   - Extract the required Moose version from dependency files
   - Install that version if not already cached
3. For non-project contexts (e.g., `moose init`):
   - Use latest installed version
   - If no version installed, fetch and install latest available version

#### Version Installation

When a required version is not found locally:
1. The wrapper downloads the appropriate version from the remote repository
2. Verifies the binary signature
3. Stores it in a local version cache (`~/.moose/versions/`)
4. Updates symlinks and path references

#### Version Cache Management

Versions will be stored in:
```
~/.moose/
  versions/
    stable/
      1.0.0/
        moose      # CLI binary only
        .last_used # Timestamp of last usage
    dev/
      1.1.0/
        moose      # CLI binary only
        .last_used # Timestamp of last usage
    ...
  current -> versions/1.1.0  # Symlink to latest version
  dev-current -> versions/dev/1.1.0  # Symlink to latest version
  wrapper    # The version-aware wrapper script
  config.toml    # Global configuration
  bin/      # Directory added to PATH
    moose   # Main entry point wrapper script
```

```config.toml
[channels]
default = "stable"
default_cache_limit = 20
default_retention_days = 7

[channels.stable]
latest_version = ""
auto_update = true
cache_limit = 100
retention_days = 90

[channels.dev]
latest_version = ""
auto_update = false
cache_limit = 20
retention_days = 7
```

##### Cache Limits and Cleanup

To prevent unlimited growth of cached versions:

1. Maximum Cache Size:
   - Hard limit of 100 versions stored locally
   - Configurable through `config.toml` (default: 100)

2. Usage Tracking:
   - Each version directory contains a `.last_used` file
   - Updated with timestamp on every use of that version
   - Used to determine least recently used versions

3. Cleanup Strategy:
   - Triggered when:
     - Installing a new version would exceed the limit
     - Running the `moose cleanup` command
   - Process:
     1. Read all `.last_used` timestamps
     2. Sort versions by last use
     3. Remove least recently used versions until under limit
     4. Always preserve:
        - Latest version
        - Currently used versions in local projects
        - Versions used in the last 30 days

4. Manual Control:
   ```bash
   # Force cleanup to specific number of versions
   moose cleanup --keep 50
   
   # Keep only versions used in last N days
   moose cleanup --days 60
   
   # List version usage statistics
   moose versions --stats
   ```

#### MCP Integration

Special considerations for MCP:
1. Wrapper script provides absolute paths to binaries
2. Configuration includes explicit paths for Claude's limited PATH environment
3. Version management respects MCP's path requirements

#### Installation Script Changes

The installation script will be modified to:
1. Detect which CLI is being installed (Aurora or Moose)
2. For Aurora:
   - Maintain current direct installation behavior
   - Install single version globally
3. For Moose:
   - Install version management wrapper
   - Support version-specific installation via flags
   - Handle PATH setup for both interactive and MCP usage

```bash
# Install Aurora (unchanged behavior)
curl -sSL https://www.fiveonefour.com/install.sh | sh -s aurora

# Install Moose wrapper
curl -sSL https://www.fiveonefour.com/install.sh | sh -s moose
```

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Project-local Installation (Current TypeScript Approach)**
   - Install via package managers (npm, pip)
   - Pros: Familiar to developers, language-native tooling
   - Cons: Multiple installation locations, version conflicts, complex multi-language support

2. **Global Version Manager (NVM-style)**
   - Manual version switching
   - Pros: Familiar pattern for developers
   - Cons: Requires manual intervention, doesn't fit Moose's project-centric nature

3. **Single Version with Compatibility Layers**
   - Maintain backward compatibility in single version
   - Pros: Simpler installation
   - Cons: Technical debt, potential compatibility issues

4. **Virtual Environment Integration**
   - Install within Python/Node virtual environments
   - Pros: Language-specific isolation
   - Cons: Complicates multi-language support, duplicate installations

5. **Unified Version Management for Both CLIs**
   - Apply same version management to both Aurora and Moose
   - Pros: Consistent behavior across tools
   - Cons: Unnecessary complexity for Aurora, breaks existing workflows

### Performance Implications

- Small initial delay when new versions need to be installed
- Negligible overhead for version checking
- Disk space usage proportional to number of cached versions
- Network usage only when new versions are required
- No performance impact on MCP operations
- No impact on Aurora performance (maintains direct installation)

### Dependencies

- Bash for wrapper script
- Curl for downloads
- GPG for signature verification
- Language package managers for library installation (out of scope)
- No additional runtime dependencies

### Engineering Impact

- Binary size: No change
- Build time: No significant impact
- Test coverage: New tests needed for version management
- Maintenance: Additional version management code
- MCP integration: Path handling modifications
- Installation script: Dual-mode support for Aurora and Moose

### Platforms and Environments

- Supports all platforms where Moose currently runs
- Requires bash-compatible shell
- Cloud environments: No special considerations needed
- CI/CD: May need configuration for version caching
- MCP: Special handling for PATH limitations

### Best Practices

- Version requirements should be specified in project configuration files
- Semantic versioning for all releases
- Clear upgrade path documentation
- Version cleanup recommendations
- Avoid using "latest" in production environments
- Regular cleanup of unused versions
- Clear distinction between Aurora and Moose installation patterns
- Use language-specific package managers for library dependencies

### Tutorials and Examples

Example workflow:
```bash
# Install Aurora (unchanged)
curl -sSL https://www.fiveonefour.com/install.sh | sh -s aurora

# Install Moose wrapper
curl -sSL https://www.fiveonefour.com/install.sh | sh -s moose

# Create new project (automatically installs required version)
moose init my-project

# Libraries are installed via language package managers
npm install  # For TypeScript projects
pip install -r requirements.txt  # For Python projects

# Switch to project with different version (automatic)
cd other-project
moose build  # Uses version from project config
```

### User Impact

- Existing projects: No immediate impact
- New projects: Automatic version management
- Migration: Optional, can continue using fixed versions
- Rollout: Gradual, with opt-in for version management
- Unified installation experience across languages
- No impact on Aurora users (maintains existing behavior)
- Libraries continue to be managed by language package managers
