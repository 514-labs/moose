# Running Scheduled Tasks
Moose provides a mechanism to schedule and execute arbitrary scripts or make HTTP `GET` calls at specified intervals via cron jobs. These jobs are useful for automating recurring tasks, for example:
- Extracting batched data from an external data source on a schedule
- Periodically calling an HTTP API to check for updates
- Cleaning up old data on a schedule
- Generating reports at a scheduled time each day
- Any other recurring task you can imagine

### Supported Task Types
- **Script Execution**: Run arbitrary scripts written in Node.js (TypeScript supported), JavaScript, or Python.
- **HTTP Requests**: Execute scheduled HTTP `GET` requests to specified endpoints.

### Scheduling Jobs
Cron jobs are scheduled using an extended cron format that includes seconds. The cron expression consists of seven fields: **seconds**, **minutes**, **hours**, **day of month**, **month**, **day of week**, and optionally **year**. Each field can specify exact values, ranges, or wildcards to define the schedule. 

<Callout type="info" title="Test Your Cron Spec" >
You can test your cron spec using this [online tool](https://www.freeformatter.com/cron-expression-generator-quartz.html).
</Callout>

## Configuration
Cron jobs are defined within the `moose.project.toml` configuration file, under the `[cron_jobs]` array. Each job entry should include:

- `job_id`: Unique identifier for the job.
- `cron_spec`: Cron expression specifying the execution schedule.
- `script_path` or `url`: Specifies the path to the arbitrary script file (TypeScript, JavaScript, or Python) or the URL of the HTTP endpoint.

<Callout type="warning" title="Job ID Must Be Unique" >
Each job ID must be unique within the project. Moose will not allow duplicate job IDs.
</Callout>

**Example:**
```toml
[[cron_jobs]]
job_id = "Fetch Data Every Second"
cron_spec = "*/1 * * * * *" // Runs every second
script_path = "app/tasks/fetch_data.py"

[[cron_jobs]]
job_id = "Daily Report"
cron_spec = "0 0 0 * * *" // Runs at midnight every day
script_path = "app/tasks/report_generator.ts"

[[cron_jobs]]
job_id = "Hourly Health Check"
cron_spec = "0 0 * * * *" // Runs every hour
url = "http://localhost:4000/health"

[[cron_jobs]]
job_id = "Weekly Report"
cron_spec = "0 0 12 * * 0" // Runs every Sunday at 12pm
url = "app/tasks/weekly_report.js"

[[cron_jobs]]
job_id = "Bi-Monthly Cleanup"
cron_spec = "0 0 0 1,15 * *" // Runs at 00:00 on the 1st and 15th of every month
script_path = "app/tasks/bi_monthly_cleanup.py"

[[cron_jobs]]
job_id = "Hourly Business Hours"
cron_spec = "0 9-17 * * * 1-5" // Runs every hour during weekday business hours (9am-5pm)
script_path = "app/tasks/business_hours_task.ts"

```



<Callout type="info" title="Cron Format" >
Moose uses the [tokio-cron-scheduler](https://crates.io/crates/tokio-cron-scheduler) library, which supports a more modern cron format with a seconds field. Note that standard crontab tools may not support this extended format.
