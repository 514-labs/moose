## Claude Desktop

<Steps>

### Install Claude Desktop
[Install the Claude Desktop application here](https://claude.ai/download). Note, the Pro version appears to work much more stably with MCPs.

### Install Moose and Aurora

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
bash -i <(curl -fsSL https://fiveonefour.com/install.sh) aurora,moose
```

### Configure Aurora MCP

<Tabs items={['Aurora CLI', 'MCP.json']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    Create a new project with Claude Desktop MCP preconfigured: 

    ```bash filename="Terminal" copy
    aurora init <project-name> <template-name> --mcp claude-desktop
    ```

    For other options, see [Aurora CLI docs](/aurora/getting-started/aurora-cli).
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```json filename="~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json" copy
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "aurora": {
          "args": [
            "@514labs/aurora-mcp@latest",
            "--moose-read-tools",
            "path/to/your/moose/project"
          ],
          "command": "npx",
          "env": {
            "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": "<your-anthropic-api-key>",
            "MOOSE_PATH": "path/to/your/moose/installation",
            "NODE_PATH": "path/to/your/node/installation",
            "PYTHON_PATH": "path/to/your/python/installation"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

### Adding other toolsets

For more information on available toolsets, see [Aurora MCP toolsets](/aurora/reference/tool-reference). For Claude Desktop, we recommend the following toolsets:

* [Moose Read Tools](../aurora/reference/tool-reference#moose-read-tools): gives you chat access to your Moose project and the data within it (enabled by default)
* [Remote ClickHouse Tools](../aurora/reference/tool-reference#remote-clickhouse) (read only): gives you chat access to your remote ClickHouse data

### Using the MCP

1. Open the Claude Desktop application (note, you often have to reload the application after adding a new MCP)
2. If you are using Moose tools, you will need to run your moose dev server

</Steps>

### Warnings / Peculiarities

* You shouldn't use "write"/genetaive tools with Claude Desktop.
* Every time you add an MCP or change its configuration, you will need to reload the application.
* If you want to change the Moose Project that the Aurora MCP is referring to, manually edit the MCP.JSON file or run `aurora config focus` and select a new project.

### Common issues / troubleshooting

* The MCP is running, but you aren't able to get your data? Look at the tool call response, it will tell you if your Moose dev server is running. If it is not, run `moose dev` in your Moose project directory.
* The MCP is not running. Check your configuration and then restart the application.
