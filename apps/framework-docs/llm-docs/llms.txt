# Moose Framework Documentation

> Moose is a framework for building and deploying data pipelines and applications. This documentation provides comprehensive guides, API references, and examples for TypeScript and Python implementations, with a focus on data workflows, ingestion, and consumption patterns.

The Moose framework documentation is organized into language-specific implementations and core concepts, covering everything from schema definitions to streaming data pipelines.
