# Moose Architecture

## How Moose Works

When you run `moose-cli dev`, Moose creates a complete development environment that combines your code with pre-configured infrastructure:

## Infrastructure Modules

Moose organizes your data pipeline into five distinct infrastructure modules:

| **Module**        | **Moose Code**                                                        | **Infrastructure**                 | **Default** |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------|
| **Ingestion**     | [Ingest APIs, Ingestion Pipeline](/moose/developing/ingestion)                                           | HTTP **POST** endpoints            | Rust        |
| **Streaming**     | [Streams](/moose/developing/streams)| Streaming topics & consumers       | Redpanda    |
| **Database**      | [Tables](/moose/developing/olap-table), [Views](/moose/developing/materialized-views)                        | OLAP tables & views                | ClickHouse  |
| **Orchestration** | [Workflows](/moose/developing/workflows)                                               | Task queue & workers               | Temporal    |
| **Consumption**   | [Analytics APIs](/moose/developing/consumption-apis)                                   | HTTP **GET** endpoints             | Rust        |
## Customizing Your Infrastructure

Moose is designed to be highly customizable. You can control which modules are included in your deployment using `moose.config.toml`:

### Default Configuration
```toml filename="moose.config.toml"
[features]
streaming_engine = true  # Include Redpanda for streaming
workflows = true        # Enable Temporal for orchestration
```
<Callout type="warning">
By default, both `streaming_engine` and `workflows` are enabled. You must set the respective features to `false` to disable them.
</Callout>

### Disabling Streaming
```toml filename="moose.config.toml"
[features]
streaming_engine = false  # Disable Redpanda for streaming
```

### Disabling Orchestration
```toml filename="moose.config.toml"
[features]
workflows = false        # Disable Temporal for orchestration
```

## Development Environment Details

| Component | Purpose | Access |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| Web Server | Handles HTTP requests for data ingestion and APIs | localhost:4000 |
| ClickHouse | Analytical database for data storage and querying | localhost:18123 |
| Redpanda | Kafka-compatible message broker for streaming | localhost:19092 |
| Temporal | Workflow orchestration engine | localhost:7233 (Server) / localhost:8080 (UI) |
| Redis | Caching and temporary storage | Internal only |

All these components are automatically configured to work together, creating a complete development environment that mirrors a production deployment.
