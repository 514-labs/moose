# Tracking Custom Events

To start instrumenting your own custom events, follow these two key steps:

1. **Create a Data Model:** Define a new Data Model containing the properties you want to represent in your custom event.
2. **Instrument Your Application:** Implement tracking in your existing application to send the custom event data to the Moose ingestion infrastructure you just set up.

## Define a New Data Model

For client-side events, we recommend beginning with the global properties found in the [`PageViewRaw` model](). From there, you can then add custom properties relevant to the specific events you want to track.

### Example: Button Click Event

If you want to track button click events, you could create a `ButtonClickEvent` Data Model with the following additional properties:

- `cta_copy` (the text on the button clicked)
- `cta_target` (the target link redirected by the button).

Add this `ButtonClickEvent` Data Model to your `models.ts` file:

```ts filename="moose/app/datamodels/models.ts" copy
export interface ButtonClickEvent extends PageViewRaw {
  cta_copy: string; // Text on the button clicked
  cta_target: string; // Target link redirected by the button
}
```

<Callout>
  The `extends PageViewRaw` approach ensures you capture both the context (via
  common web analytics data fields) and the specific user interaction details
  for the event.
</Callout>

### Save Your Changes

Moose will configure the same infrastructure components you already have for the `PageViewRaw`, but this time these components are typed to the schema for the new `ButtonClickEvent` model.

Validate that Moose configured all the infrastructure for you by opening a new terminal window and running the following command:

```bash filename="terminal" copy
npx moose-cli ls
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Make sure you are in the `moose` project directory and your dev server is
  running (`moose dev`)
</Callout>

## Sending Custom Events

  <Tabs.Tab>
    If your custom event is being instrumented from the client side of your web app, you can leverage the same `script.js` file you used to capture page view events.

    #### Example: Tracking Button Click Events

    Add the following code to the `onClick()` event handler for the button you want to track:

    ```tsx filename="Your Web App Client Code" copy
    ...
    // Capture the button text and target URL
    window.MooseAnalytics.trackEvent("ButtonClickEvent", {
      cta_copy: BUTTON_COPY, // Dynamically capture the button text
      cta_target: BUTTON_HREF, // Capture the target URL
    });

    ...
    ```
    Notes:
    - The first argument to `trackEvent()` corresponds to the name of the Data Model you defined for your custom event
    - The second argument is an object containing the properties unique to the `ButtonClickEvent` Data Model (in this case, `cta_copy` and `cta_target`)
    - The integrated script enriches the event data with common web analytics properties defined in the `PageViewRaw` model. This means you do not need to manually set these properties, as they are automatically appended to the event payload in the tracking script.

    If your custom event is being instrumented from the server side of your application, you can use the generated Ingestion SDK to send server-side events to Moose.

    See the [SDK documentation](/building/ingest-data/ingest-sdk) for more information on how to generate the SDK for your Data Models.

    #### Example: Tracking Button Click Events
    Use the `sendButtonClickEvent()` function from the generated SDK to send the custom event data:

    ```ts filename="Your Server-Side Code" copy
    import { sendButtonClickEvent } from "/path/to/sdk";
    ...
    // Send the server-side event
    sendButtonClickEvent({
      cta_copy: BUTTON_TEXT,
      cta_target: BUTTON_HREF,
      eventId: EVENT_ID,
      timestamp: new Date(),
      session_id: SESSION_ID,
      ...
      /* Set rest of the default properties */
    });
    ```

  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>
