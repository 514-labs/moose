### Other clients

We are working on adding MCP support for other clients. If you are interested in using other clients, please [contact us](mailto:aurora@fiveonefour.com).

To try set up your client with Aurora MCP, use the MCP.JSON file within your client of choice.

<Steps>

### Configure Aurora MCP

```json filename="~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json" copy
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aurora": {
      "args": [
        "@514labs/aurora-mcp@latest",
        "--moose-read-tools",
        "path/to/your/moose/project"
      ],
      "command": "npx",
      "env": {
        "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": "<your-anthropic-api-key>",
        "MOOSE_PATH": "path/to/your/moose/installation",
        "NODE_PATH": "path/to/your/node/installation",
        "PYTHON_PATH": "path/to/your/python/installation"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Adding other toolsets

For more information on available toolsets, see [Aurora MCP toolsets](/aurora/reference/tool-reference). If the client you are using is a chat client, we recommend the following toolsets:

* [Moose Read Tools](../aurora/reference/tool-reference#moose-read-tools): gives you chat access to your Moose project and the data within it (enabled by default)
* [Remote ClickHouse Tools](../aurora/reference/tool-reference#remote-clickhouse) (read only): gives you chat access to your remote ClickHouse data

If it is an IDE type client, all toolsets are available.

### Using the MCP

1. Open the Claude Desktop application (note, you often have to reload the application after adding a new MCP)
2. If you are using Moose tools, you will need to run your moose dev server

</Steps>

### Common issues / troubleshooting

* The MCP is running, but you aren't able to get your data? Look at the tool call response, it will tell you if your Moose dev server is running. If it is not, run `moose dev` in your Moose project directory.
* The MCP is not running. Check your configuration and then restart the application.
