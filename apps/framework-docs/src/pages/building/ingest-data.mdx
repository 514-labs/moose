# Ingesting Data

Once you've defined a Data Model, Moose makes it easy to ingest data from upstream data sources
that align to the schema of your Data Model. There are two main ways to ingest data:

1. Pushing data to the Ingestion API Endpoint that Moose automatically creates for each Data Model
2. Instrumenting an upstream application using an SDK that Moose automatically creates for each Data Model -
   this SDK makes it easy to capture data to send to the API Endpoint automatically

The following sections will walk you through both methods.
