# Ingest

## Ingest data periodically from an API

This demo will walk you through using Sloan tools to prompt your way to ingesting a whole bunch of aircraft telemetry data from adsb.lol.

[Skip to prompt](#prompt-the-llm-to-create-an-ingest) if you started with the ads-b template.

<Callout type="info" title="Prerequisites">
- **Sloan and Moose CLIs**: [Install them here](/sloan/getting-started/cursor)
- **OS**: macOS or Linux (WSL supported for Windows)
- **Docker Desktop/Engine**: [24.0.0+](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)
- **Node**: [version 20+](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (LTS recommended)
- **Anthropic API Key**: [Get one here](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/initial-setup)
- **Client**: [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) 
</Callout>

<Steps>

### Create and initialize a new typescript project

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
sloan init ingest-demo typescript-empty
```

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
cd ingest-demo
npm install
```

### Open the project in Cursor

### Run the Moose Dev Servers

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
moose dev 
```

### Initialize the Sloan MCP

Navigate to `Cursor > Settings > Cursor Settings > Tools and Integrations` then toggle on the `Sloan MCP` tool.

### For best results, set the LLM to `claude-4-sonnet`

Gemini 2.5 and o3 are also reasonably good, but claude-4-sonnet has the most consistent results.

### Prompt the LLM to create an ingest

> I want to ingest data from the following aircraft transponder data api every 5 seconds for the purpose of creating a set of visualizations.
> 
> API: @https://api.adsb.lol/v2/mil 
>
> Docs: @https://api.adsb.lol/docs#/v2/v2_mil_v2_mil_get (note, I think the schema here is inaccurate, check out the data before you trust the docs).
> 
> Can you execute on this?

The LLM might do a planning step, in which case, you can ask it to execute on the plan.

> Go for it!

### Action

The LLM should now use sloan tools to:
1. get sample data from the API using a temporary script
2. use that sample to create a schema that's used to create an ingest pipeline (ingest API, Redpanda stream, ClickHouse table)
3. create a Moose managed temporal workflow to periodically ingest the data

You'll know it is succeeding if you see dozens of events per second hit your Moose dev console.
