# Workflow Orchestration

<LanguageSwitcher />

## Overview

Moose workflows enable developers to automate sequences of tasks in a maintainable, reliable way. A workflow is a series of tasks that execute in order. Each workflow follows these conventions:

- Workflows live in folders inside the `/app/scripts` subdirectory, with the folder name being the workflow name.
- Tasks are scripts with numerical prefixes (e.g., <Python inline>`1.first_task.py`</Python><TypeScript inline>`1.firstTask.ts`</TypeScript>).
- Configuration is managed through `config.toml` files.

<Callout type="info" title="Powered by Temporal">
This workflow abstraction is powered by Temporal under the hood. You can use the Temporal GUI to monitor your workflow runs as they execute, providing extra debugging capabilities.
</Callout>

## Quickstart

To create a new workflow, run the following command:

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
moose workflow init example --tasks first,second
```

## Workflow Structure

A typical workflow looks like this:

<Python>
<FileTree>
<FileTree.Folder name="app" open>
<FileTree.Folder name="scripts" open>
<FileTree.Folder name="example" open>
<FileTree.File name="1.first.py" />
<FileTree.File name="2.second.py" />
<FileTree.File name="config.toml" />
</FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>
</Python>

<TypeScript>
<FileTree>
<FileTree.Folder name="app" open>
<FileTree.Folder name="scripts" open>
<FileTree.Folder name="example" open>
<FileTree.File name="1.first.ts" />
<FileTree.File name="2.second.ts" />
<FileTree.File name="config.toml" />
</FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>
</TypeScript>

## Writing Workflow Tasks

<Python>

Tasks are Python functions decorated with `@task`. Each task can receive inputs and return outputs:

```python filename="app/scripts/example/1.first.py" copy
from moose_lib import task, Logger

@task
def first(input: dict):
    logger = Logger('first')
    logger.info(f'Received data: {input}')
    
    # Example operation: Increment a counter
    result = input.get("counter", 0) + 1
    
    return {
        "task": "first",
        "data": {
            "counter": result,
            "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat()
        }
    }
```
</Python>

<TypeScript>

Tasks are defined as asynchronous functions (of type `TaskFunction`) that perform some operations and return an object with two key properties: `task` and `data`.

```typescript filename="app/scripts/example/1.first.ts" copy
import { TaskFunction, TaskDefinition } from "@514labs/moose-lib";

interface FirstTaskInput {
    name: string;
}

const first: TaskFunction = async (input: FirstTaskInput) => {
    const name = input.name ?? "world";
    const greeting = `hello, ${name}!`;
    
    return {
        task: "first",
        data: {
            name: name,
            greeting: greeting,
            counter: 1
        }
    };
};

export default function createTask() {
    return {
        task: first,
    } as TaskDefinition;
};
```

The file must export a function that returns a `TaskDefinition` object. This object is used to register the task with the workflow. Inside this `TaskDefinition` object, you must specify the `task`, which is the function you defined above.
</TypeScript>


## Data Flow Between Tasks

Tasks communicate through their return values. Each task can return a dictionary containing a `data` key. The contents of this `data` key are automatically passed as input parameters to the next task in the workflow.

- Only values inside the `data` object are passed to the next task.
- Supported data types inside `data` include basic types, containers, and JSON-serializable custom classes.

<Python>
```python filename="app/scripts/example/1.first.py" copy
from moose_lib import task, Logger

@task
def first(input: dict):
    logger = Logger('first')
    logger.info(f'Received input: {input}')

    name = input.get("name", "no name")
    greeting = f"hello, {name}!"
    counter = 1


    return {
        "task": "first",
        "data": {
            "name": name,
            "greeting": greeting,
            "counter": counter
        }
    }
```
```python filename="app/scripts/example/2.second.py" copy
from moose_lib import task, Logger

@task
def second(input: dict):

    logger = Logger('second')
    logger.info(f'Received input: {input}')

    name = input.get("name", "no name")
    greeting = input.get("greeting", "no greeting")
    counter = input.get("counter", 0)

    name_length = len(name)
    expanded_greeting = f"{greeting} Your name is {name_length} characters long"
    
    return {
        "task": "second",
        "data": {
            "name": name,
            "greeting": expanded_greeting,
            "counter": counter,
            "name_length": name_length
        }
    }
```
</Python>

<TypeScript>
```typescript filename="app/scripts/example/1.first.ts" copy
import { TaskFunction, TaskDefinition } from "@514labs/moose-lib";

interface FirstTaskInput {
    name: string;
}

const first: TaskFunction = async (input: FirstTaskInput) => {
    const name = input.name ?? "world";
    const greeting = `hello, ${name}!`;
    
    return {
        task: "first",
        data: {
            name: name,
            greeting: greeting,
            counter: 1
        }
    };
};

export default function createTask() {
    return {
        task: first,
    } as TaskDefinition;
}; 
```
```typescript filename="app/scripts/example/2.second.ts" copy
import { TaskFunction, TaskDefinition } from "@514labs/moose-lib";

interface SecondTaskInput {
    name: string;
    greeting: string;
    counter: number;
}

const second: TaskFunction = async (input: SecondTaskInput) => {
    const nameLength = input.name.length;
    const expandedGreeting = `${input.greeting} Your name is ${nameLength} characters long`;

    // Example operation: Double the counter value
    const counter = input.counter + 1;
    
    return {
        task: "secondTask",
        data: {
            name: input.name,
            greeting: expandedGreeting,
            counter: counter,
            nameLength: nameLength
        }
    };
};

export default function createTask() {
    return {
        task: second,
    } as TaskDefinition;
};
```
</TypeScript>

## Running Workflows

As you develop workflows, you can run them directly using the Moose CLI:

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
moose workflow run example
```
The terminal will print the following:
```txt filename="Terminal"
      Workflow 'example' started successfully.
View it in the Temporal dashboard: http://localhost:8080/namespaces/default/workflows/example/3a1cc066-33bf-49ce-8671-63ecdcb72f2a/history
```

Notice that you are given a URL to view the workflow in the Temporal dashboard. This is a helpful way to monitor the workflow execution in real time and debug any issues through a GUI.

### Passing Input to Workflows
When you run a workflow, you can pass input to the workflow by using the `--input` flag.

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
moose workflow run example --input '{"name": "John"}'
```

The input is passed to the workflow as a JSON string.

## Debugging Workflows
While the Temporal dashboard is a helpful tool for debugging, you can also leverage the Moose CLI to monitor and debug workflows. This is useful if you want to monitor a workflow without having to leave your terminal.

Use the `moose workflow status` command to monitor a workflow:

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
moose workflow status example
```

This will print high level information about the workflow run:

```txt filename="Terminal"
      Workflow Workflow Status: example
Run ID: 446eab6e-663d-4913-93fe-f79d6109391f
Status: WORKFLOW_EXECUTION_STATUS_COMPLETED ✅
Execution Time: 66s
```

If you want more detailed information about the workflow's status, including task level logs and inputs/outputs, you can use the `--verbose` flag:

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
moose workflow status example --verbose
```

```txt filename="Terminal"
      Workflow Workflow Status: example
Run ID: 446eab6e-663d-4913-93fe-f79d6109391f
Status: WORKFLOW_EXECUTION_STATUS_COMPLETED ✅
Execution Time: 66s
Request: GetWorkflowExecutionHistoryRequest { namespace: "default", execution: Some(WorkflowExecution { workflow_id: "example", run_id: "446eab6e-663d-4913-93fe-f79d6109391f" }), maximum_page_size: 0, next_page_token: [], wait_new_event: false, history_event_filter_type: Unspecified, skip_archival: false }

      }
```

With this more detailed output, you can see the exact sequence of events and the inputs and outputs of each task. This is useful for debugging and understanding the workflow's behavior.
The result of each task is included in the output, allowing you to inspect the data that was passed between task for debugging purposes.

If your workflow fails due to some runtime error, you can use the event history timeline to identify the task that failed.

## Scheduling Workflows
Workflows can be configured to run on a schedule using cron expressions or a string `"@every <interval>"`. The `schedule` field in `config.toml` is used to specify the schedule. This field is optional, and blank by default:

### Cron Expressions
```toml filename="app/scripts/example/config.toml" {4}
name = "example"
timeout = "1h"
retries = 3
schedule = "" ## DEFAULT: Blank
tasks = ["first", "second"]
```

By setting a cron expression in this field, the workflow will be scheduled to run at the specified interval. The schedule field uses standard cron expression syntax:

```toml filename="app/scripts/example/config.toml"
schedule = "0 12 * * *" # Runs at 12:00 PM every day
```


```text
|------------------------------- Minute (0-59)
|     |------------------------- Hour (0-23)
|     |     |------------------- Day of the month (1-31)
|     |     |     |------------- Month (1-12; or JAN to DEC)
|     |     |     |     |------- Day of the week (0-6; or SUN to SAT; or 7 for Sunday)
|     |     |     |     |
|     |     |     |     |
*     *     *     *     *
```

Below are some example cron expressions along with their scheduling details:

| Cron Expression             | Description                                   |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| <code>0 12 * * *</code>      | Runs at 12:00 PM every day                    |
| <code>0 0 * * 0</code>       | Runs at 12:00 AM every Sunday                 |
| <code>0 8 * * 1-5</code>      | Runs at 8:00 AM on weekdays (Monday to Friday)|
| <code>* * * * *</code>        | Runs every minute                             |

<Callout type="info" title="Cron Expression Visualizer">
Use an online cron expression visualizer like [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru/) to help you understand how the cron expression will schedule your workflow.
</Callout>


If your dev server is running, you should see logs in the terminal when your scheduled workflow is executed to make sure your schedule is working as expected.

### Interval Schedules

Interval schedules are specified as a string `"@every <interval>"`. The interval is a string that follows the format `"1h"`, `"1m"`, `"1s"`, etc.

```toml filename="app/scripts/example/config.toml" copy
schedule = "@every 1h"
```



## Advanced: Triggering Workflows Programmatically
You can create an API to trigger workflows by using the `MooseClient` that is automatically instantiated and passed to your API route handler:


<TypeScript>
```typescript filename="app/apis/trigger_workflow.ts" copy
import { MooseClient, ConsumptionAPI } from "@514labs/moose-lib";

interface WorkflowParams {
    input_value: string;
}

const triggerApi = new ConsumptionAPI<WorkflowParams>("/trigger-workflow", (client: MooseClient) => {
    client.workflows.execute(
        workflow="example",
        params={input_value: params.input_value}
    )
})
```
</TypeScript>

<Python>


```python filename="app/apis/trigger_workflow.py" copy
from moose_lib import MooseClient, ConsumptionAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class WorkflowParams(BaseModel):
    input_value: str = Field(default="default")

def run(client: MooseClient, params: WorkflowParams) -> dict:
    return client.workflows.execute(
        workflow="example",
        params={input_value: params.input_value}
    )

api = ConsumptionAPI[WorkflowParams]("trigger-workflow", run)
```

For more information on how to set up a Moose API, see the [Consumption API](/moose/building/consumption-apis) documentation.
</Python>

<TypeScript>
```ts filename="app/apis/trigger_workflow.ts" copy
import { ConsumptionAPI } from "@514labs/moose-lib";

interface WorkflowParams {
    inputValue: string;
}

const triggerApi = new ConsumptionAPI<WorkflowParams>("trigger-workflow", ({inputValue}: WorkflowParams, {client, sql}) => {
    client.workflows.execute(workflow="example", params={inputValue: inputValue})
})
```
</TypeScript>



## Error Detection and Handling
Moose provides multiple layers of error protection, both at the workflow and task level:

### Workflow-Level Retries and Timeouts

Moose automatically catches any runtime errors during workflow execution. Errors are logged for debugging, and the orchestrator will retry failed tasks according to the retry count in `config.toml`.

In your workflow's `config.toml` file, you can configure the following options to control workflow behavior, including timeouts and retries:

```toml filename="app/scripts/example/config.toml" {2-3} copy
name = "example" # Required. The name of the workflow. Matches the workflow folder name.
timeout = "1h" # Required. Default: 1 hour
retries = 3 # Required. Default: 3 retries
schedule = "0 12 * * *" # Required. Default: Blank
tasks = ["first", "second"] # Required. The list of tasks to execute. Matches the task file names.
```


<Callout type="warning" title="Config.toml">
When you initialize a new workflow, the `config.toml` file is automatically created with the default values.
- workflow name: Matches the workflow name you specified when you initialized the workflow.
- timeout: 1 hour
- retries: 3
- schedule: Blank
- tasks: Matches the task names you specified in the `--tasks` flag when you initialized the workflow.
</Callout>

### Task-Level Errors and Retries

For more granular control over task-level errors and retries, you can configure your individual tasks to have their own retry behavior:

<Python>
To configure a task to have its own retry behavior, you can use the `retries` parameter in the `@task` decorator:

```python filename="app/scripts/example/1.first_task.py" {3} copy
from moose_lib import task

@task(retries=3) 
def first(input: dict):
    raise Exception("This is a test error")
    return {
        "task": "first",
        "data": {}
    }
```
</Python>

<TypeScript>
To configure a task to have its own retry behavior, you can add a `config` object to the task definition, and specify a number of `retries` within that object:

```typescript filename="app/scripts/example/1.first.ts" {16-18} copy
import { TaskFunction, TaskDefinition } from "@514labs/moose-lib";

const first: TaskFunction = async () => {
    throw new Error("This is a test error");
    return {
        task: "first",
        data: {}
    };
};

export default function createTask() {
    return {
        task: first,
        config: {
            retries: 3 // This is optional. If you don't explicitly set retries, it will default to 3. 
        }
    } as TaskDefinition;
}
```
</TypeScript>

### Example: Workflow and Task Retry Interplay

When configuring retries, it's important to understand how workflow-level and task-level retries interact. Consider the following scenario:

<Python>
- **Workflow Retry Policy**: 2 attempts
```toml filename="app/scripts/example/config.toml" {2}
retries = 2
```

- **Task Retry Policy**: 3 attempts
```python filename="app/scripts/example/1.first.py" {3}
@task(retries=3) 
def first(input: dict):
    raise Exception("This is a test error")
    
    return {
        "task": "first",
        "data": {}
    }
```
</Python>

<TypeScript>
- **Workflow Retry Policy**: 2 attempts
```toml filename="app/scripts/example/config.toml" {2}
retries = 2
```

- **Task Retry Policy**: 3 attempts
```typescript filename="app/scripts/example/1.first.ts" {16-18} copy
import { TaskFunction, TaskDefinition } from "@514labs/moose-lib";

const first: TaskFunction = async () => {
    throw new Error("This is a test error");
    return {
        task: "first",
        data: {}
    };
};

export default function createTask() {
    return {
        task: first,
        config: {
            retries: 3 // This is optional. If you don't explicitly set retries, it will default to 3. 
        }
    } as TaskDefinition;
}
```
</TypeScript>

If the execution of the workflow encounters an error, the retry sequence would proceed as follows:

1. **Workflow Attempt 1**
   - **Task Attempt 1**: Task fails
   - **Task Attempt 2**: Task fails
   - **Task Attempt 3**: Task fails
   - Workflow attempt fails after exhausting task retries

2. **Workflow Attempt 2**
   - **Task Attempt 1**: Task fails
   - **Task Attempt 2**: Task fails
   - **Task Attempt 3**: Task fails
   - Workflow attempt fails after exhausting task retries

In this example, the workflow will make a total of 2 attempts, and each task within those attempts will retry up to 3 times before the workflow itself retries.

### Terminating Workflows

To terminate a workflow before it has finished running, use the `workflow terminate` command.

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
moose workflow terminate example
```

<Callout type="warning" title="Terminating Workflows">
You cannot run the same workflow concurrently. Use the `terminate` command to stop the workflow before triggering it again.
</Callout>
