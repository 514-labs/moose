# Create Flow in CLI

Initiate your flow setup in Moose with the `moose flow init` CLI command. This command structures your project's directory and creates necessary files based on your specified data models.

```txt filename="Terminal" copy
moose flow init --source <YourSourceDataModel> --destination <YourDestinationDataModel>
```

This command takes two arguments: `--source` and `--destination`, which should each be followed by the name of the source and destination data models you wish to connect through this flow.
These data models must exist before you create your data flow. You can find a list of your existing data flows in `/datamodels/models.prisma`.

By way of example:

```txt filename="Terminal" copy
moose flow init --source UserActivity --destination ParsedActivity
```

Represents a data flow from a source data model `UserActivity` and a destination data model `ParsedActivity`, which themselves were defined in `/datamodels/models.prisma`:

```ts filename="models.prisma"
model UserActivity {
  ...
}

model ParsedActivity {
  ...
}
```

Ensure your development server is running to keep Moose updated with your data model definitions.

When you run this command, you will create the data flow file and file structure described below.

  Alpha warning: You will soon also be able to see your data flow in your

# Directory Structure Post-Initialization

Running the `moose flow init` command with valid arguments will create a `flow.ts` file to represent this newly created data flow, in the following directory structure:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="my-moose-app" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="flows" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.Folder name="UserActivity" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.Folder name="ParsedActivity" defaultOpen>
          <FileTree.File name="flow.ts" />
        </FileTree.Folder>
      </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

In the example above

```txt filename="Terminal"
my-moose-app/flows/UserActivity/ParsedActivity/flow.ts
```

Where:

|                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| UserActivity   | is the source data model Moose monitors for new data.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ParsedActivity | is the destination data model where Moose routes the transformed data.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| flow.ts        | is the transformation function file that contains the logic for data transformation. As long as this file is named `flow.ts`, Moose will apply the default function to each new data entry from the source, and save the output to the destination. |

The `flow.ts` file is a TypeScript file that you use to define the transformation needed to get from your source data model to the destination.
In the `flow.ts` file created, Moose provides starter code. This code includes imports for your source and destination data model interfaces and sets up a default function template. The function is pre-configured with the correct argument and return types based on the specified data models:

```ts filename="flow.ts" copy {2-3,7}
// Add your models & start the development server to import these types
import { UserActivity } from "/path/to/UserActivity.ts";
import { ParsedActivity } from "/path/to/ParsedActivity.ts";

// The 'run' function transforms source data to destination format.
// For more details on how Moose flows work, see: https://docs.moosejs.com
export default function run(event: UserActivity): ParsedActivity | null {
  return null;
}
```

# Develop Transformation Logic

Now that you have your data flow file, `flow.ts`, you have to define the transformations within it:
how you want to change the data in the source data model to get to the output anticipated by the destination data model.

**This requires a default export function:** The transformation function should be the file's default export, allowing Moose to automatically identify and execute it.

**And allows for type definitions:** Use TypeScript interfaces generated for your data models to type-check the function's input and output, ensuring they match the source and destination data models, respectively.

Here's an example `flow.ts` that converts timestamps to UTC:

```ts filename="flow.ts" copy {3-4,8}
// Example flow function: Converts local timestamps in UserEvent data to UTC.
// Imports: Source (UserActivity) and Destination (ParsedActivity) data models.
import { UserActivity } from "/path/to/UserActivity.ts";
import { ParsedActivity } from "/path/to/ParsedActivity.ts";

// The 'convertUtc' function transforms UserActivity data to ParsedActivity format.
// For more details on how Moose flows work, see: <https://docs.moosejs.com/flows>
export default function convertUtc(event: UserActivity): ParsedActivity {
  // Convert local timestamp to UTC and return new ParsedActivity object.
  return {
    id: event.id, // Retain original event ID.
    userId: "puid" + event.userId, // Example: Prefix user ID.
    activity: event.activity, // Copy activity unchanged.
    timestamp: new Date(event.timestamp.toUTCString()), // Convert timestamp to UTC.
  };
}
```

Adjust function specifics according to your data transformation needs. This structured approach ensures clarity in your
data processing tasks, enabling Moose to efficiently handle and automate data flows.

# Validate Your Flow

To test and confirm your flow's logic:

1. Send Test Data: Ingest test data into the source data model to trigger the flow.
2. Verify Transformation: After the flow processes the data, check the destination model in the
   Moose developer console to see if the data has been transformed correctly.

For detailed instructions on data ingestion, consult the [Ingesting Data](../data-models/capture-data.mdx) section of the documentation.
