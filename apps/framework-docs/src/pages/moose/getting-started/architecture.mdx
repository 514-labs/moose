# Moose Architecture

<ZoomImg light="/overview-arch-light.png" dark="/overview-arch-dark.png" alt="Moose Development Environment" />

## Infrastructure

Moose supports all the core infrastructure needed to power an analytical backend. Moose translates your native Typescript/Python/SQL into components in this underlying infrastructure.

| Infrastructure<br />Category | Supported<br />Software         | What You<br />Write                            | What Moose<br />Generates        |
|:-----------------------------|:--------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------|
| Realtime analytical database | Clickhouse                      | Data models as TS interfaces / Pydantic models | Tables                           |
|                              |                                 | SQL statements in TS/Py functions              | Views                            |
| Streaming engine             | Redpanda                        | Data models as TS interfaces / Pydantic models | Topics                           |
| Processing engine            | TS/Py (built into Moose binary) | TS/Py functions                                | Orchestrated streaming functions |
| Orchestration engine         | Temporal                        | TS/Py scripts                                  | Orchestrated workflows           |
| Webservers                   | Rust (built into Moose binary)  | Data models as TS interfaces / Pydantic models | Ingest APIs                      |
|                              |                                 | Parameterized SQL queries in TS/Py functions   | Egress APIs                      |


## Customizing Your Infrastructure

Moose is designed to be highly customizable. You can control which infrastructure is included in your deployment using `moose.config.toml`:

### Default Configuration
```toml filename="moose.config.toml"
[features]
streaming_engine = true  # Include Redpanda for streaming
workflows = true        # Enable Temporal for orchestration
```
<Callout type="warning">
By default, both `streaming_engine` and `workflows` are enabled. You must set the respective features to `false` to disable them.
</Callout>

### Disabling Streaming
```toml filename="moose.config.toml"
[features]
streaming_engine = false  # Disable Redpanda for streaming
```

### Disabling Orchestration
```toml filename="moose.config.toml"
[features]
workflows = false        # Disable Temporal for orchestration
```

## Development Environment Details

| Component | Purpose | Access |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| Web Server | Handles HTTP requests for data ingestion and APIs | localhost:4000 |
| ClickHouse | Analytical database for data storage and querying | localhost:18123 |
| Redpanda | Kafka-compatible message broker for streaming | localhost:19092 |
| Temporal | Workflow orchestration engine | localhost:7233 (Server) / localhost:8080 (UI) |
| Redis | Caching and temporary storage | Internal only |

All these components are automatically configured to work together, creating a complete development environment that mirrors a production deployment.
