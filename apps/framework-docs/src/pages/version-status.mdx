## Moose is Alpha Software

Thank you so much for your interest in [Moose](https://www.moosejs.com/), the developer
framework for your data & analytics stack. Moose is still in Alpha, and is not yet recommended
for critical production use cases. That being said, we’d love for you to get your hands on it and try it out.

Moose is in active development, and we’re looking for feedback and insights on how to harden and improve,
as we build towards the Beta release. You can reach us at [hello@moosejs.dev](mailto:hello@moosejs.dev) or
in our [developer communities](https://www.moosejs.com/community) on
[Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/moose-community/shared_invite/zt-2fjh5n3wz-cnOmM9Xe9DYAgQrNu8xKxg)

## Versioning

All packages and builds are synced and versioned when published to repositories. It makes it easy to understand
the compatibility levels of the different components.

Prior to 1.0.0, there is no guaranteed compatibility between components of different versions, beside the
components with the exact same version numbers.

You can expect the same major and minor and patch versions of components to be compatible with each other.
