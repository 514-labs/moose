# Creating Materialized Views

One powerful use of the `Blocks` object in Moose is setting up materialized views, which summarize and transform large datasets into easily queryable tables. This setup precomputes the results of your queries, leading to more efficient data retrieval from your Moose application.

## Setting up Materialized Views with `createAggregation()`

<Callout type="warning" title="Ensure Block Initialization">
  Before setting up your aggregation, make sure you have already initialized a
  Block. Learn how to [initialize a new block](./init-block.mdx).
</Callout>

The `createAggregation()` function in Moose makes it easy to define a materialized view by specifying a query and a destination table for your aggregated data.

### Example

Using the `ParsedActivity_0_0` table from the starter code provided by `create-moose-app`, here’s how to create a `UserActivitySummary` table and a corresponding `UserActivitySummaryMV` materialized view. This view tracks the number of unique users (`unique_user_count`) and total activities (`activity_count`) for each activity type:

```typescript filename="/blocks/example-aggregation.ts" copy
import {
  createAggregation,
  Blocks,
  ClickHouseEngines,
} from "@514labs/moose-lib";

// Define the destination table and materialized view
const DESTINATION_TABLE = "UserActivitySummary";
const MATERIALIZED_VIEW = "UserActivitySummaryMV";

// Define the query to aggregate the data
const selectQuery = `
  SELECT 
    activity,
    uniqState(userId) as unique_user_count, 
    countState(activity) AS activity_count 
  FROM 
    ParsedActivity_0_0 
  GROUP BY 
    activity
`;

// Create the aggregation
export default {
  setup: createAggregation({
    tableCreateOptions: {
      name: DESTINATION_TABLE, // Name of the destination table
      columns: {
        activity: "String", // Column type for activity name
        unique_user_count: "AggregateFunction(uniq, String)", // Column type for unique user count
        activity_count: "AggregateFunction(count, String)", // Column type for total activity count
      },
      orderBy: "activity", // Order the table by activity name
      engine: ClickHouseEngines.AggregatingMergeTree, // Use the AggregatingMergeTree engine for efficient aggregate funciton performance
    },
    materializedViewName: MATERIALIZED_VIEW, // Name of the materialized view
    select: selectQuery, // SQL query for aggregating data
  }),
} as Blocks;
```

### Explanation of Parameters

- `tableCreateOptions`: Defines the schema for the destination table:

  - `name`: The table name where the aggregated data will be stored.
  - `columns`: An object specifying column names and data types.
  - `orderBy`: Defines the column by which the table will be ordered. In this case, it’s the `activity` column.
  - `engine`: Specifies the ClickHouse engine to use, such as `MergeTree` for efficient storage and querying.

- `materializedViewName`: The name of the materialized view that will be created.

- `select`: A SQL query that determines how data will be aggregated from the source table and inserted into the materialized view.

<Callout type="info" title="Workflow Tip">
  Test your query in a SQL explorer for a more efficient workflow. Once
  satisfied, copy and paste it into the aggregation file. Be sure to validate
  your query using the [Clickhouse SQL
  Reference](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/aggregate-functions/reference)
  to ensure it adheres to ClickHouse's syntax.
</Callout>

### How the Materialized View is Created

When you save the file, Moose will:

1. Create a new table in your database using the structure defined in the `tableCreateOptions`.
2. Execute the `select` query to aggregate data from the source table.
3. Populate the destination table with the aggregated result set.

<Callout type="info" title="How Materialized Views Work">
  Materialized Views in ClickHouse automatically refresh your target table with
  the latest query results whenever new data is added to your source tables.

## API Reference

This section provides detailed reference information for the `Blocks` object and its key methods: `createAggregation()` and `dropAggregation()`.

### Defining a `Blocks` Object

The `Blocks` object in Moose handles the setup and teardown of data aggregations, such as materialized views. It consists of two main parameters: `setup` and `teardown`. Each accepts an array of SQL statements that Moose will execute against the database to manage the lifecycle of the data.

#### Example Usage

```typescript
import { Blocks } from "@514labs/moose-lib";

export default {
  setup: [...createAggregation({...})],
  teardown: [...dropAggregation({...})],
} as Blocks;
```

---

### `createAggregation()` Function

The `createAggregation()` function sets up a materialized view based on a SQL query. It specifies the structure of the destination table and the query that will populate it.

#### Signature

```typescript
createAggregation(options: AggregationCreateOptions): string[]
```

#### Parameters

- `options` _(AggregationCreateOptions)_:  
  An object defining how the aggregation will be set up, including table creation options, the materialized view name, and the aggregation query.

##### `AggregationCreateOptions` Object Properties

- `tableCreateOptions` _(TableCreateOptions)_:  
  Defines how the destination table should be created, including:

  - `name`: Name of the table.
  - `columns`: A list of column names and their data types.
  - `engine`: The ClickHouse engine to use (e.g., `MergeTree`).
  - `orderBy`: The column used to order the table.

- `materializedViewName` _(string)_:  
  The name of the materialized view to create.

- `select` _(string)_:  
  The SQL query that defines how the data will be aggregated and inserted into the materialized view.

##### Example Usage

```typescript
createAggregation({
  tableCreateOptions: {
    name: "UserActionSummary",
    columns: {
      activity: "String",
      unique_user_count: "AggregateFunction(uniq, String)",
      activity_count: "AggregateFunction(count, String)",
    },
    orderBy: "activity",
    engine: ClickHouseEngines.AggregatingMergeTree,
  },
  materializedViewName: "UserActionSummaryMV",
  select: `SELECT 
    activity, 
    uniqState(userId) as unique_user_count, 
    countState(activity) AS activity_count 
  FROM ParsedActivity_0_0 
  GROUP BY activity`,
});
```

#### **Return Value**

- `string[]`:  
  Returns an array of SQL statements that will be executed to set up the materialized view and its destination table.

---

### `dropAggregation()` Function

The `dropAggregation()` function removes an existing aggregation by dropping the materialized view and the associated table.

#### Signature

```typescript
dropAggregation(options: AggregationDropOptions): string[]
```

#### Parameters

- `options` _(AggregationDropOptions)_:  
  An object specifying which materialized view and table should be dropped.

##### `AggregationDropOptions` Object Properties

- `viewName` _(string)_:  
  The name of the materialized view to drop.

- `tableName` _(string)_:  
  The name of the destination table to drop.

##### Example Usage

```typescript
dropAggregation({
  viewName: "UserActivitySummaryMV",
  tableName: "UserActivitySummary",
});
```

#### Return Value

- **`string[]`**:  
  Returns an array of SQL statements that, when executed in order, will drop the specified materialized view and its associated table.

---

### ClickHouseEngines Enum

The `ClickHouseEngines` enum defines the storage engines available in Moose for creating tables in ClickHouse. These engines determine how data is stored, indexed, and queried.

#### Available Engines

```typescript filename="moose-lib-ts/blocks.ts"
enum ClickHouseEngines {
  MergeTree = "MergeTree",
  ReplacingMergeTree = "ReplacingMergeTree",
  SummingMergeTree = "SummingMergeTree",
  AggregatingMergeTree = "AggregatingMergeTree",
  CollapsingMergeTree = "CollapsingMergeTree",
  VersionedCollapsingMergeTree = "VersionedCollapsingMergeTree",
  GraphiteMergeTree = "GraphiteMergeTree",
}
```

#### Usage

```typescript
import { ClickHouseEngines } from "@514labs/moose-lib";

const engine = ClickHouseEngines.ReplacingMergeTree;
```
