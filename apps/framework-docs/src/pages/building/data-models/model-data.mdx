## Creating a Model

To get started you simply need to open the `models.ts` file in your project's `datamodels` directory
and add a new Data Model definition.

```ts filename="datamodels/models.ts" copy
type Key<T extends string | number> = T;

export interface UserActivity {
  eventId: Key<string>;
  timestamp: string;
  userId: string;
  activity: string;
}
```

## Data Model conventions

As you can see, the data model is very simple. It's just a list of fields and their types.
MooseJS's data modeling is integrated with the data modeling capabilities of your language of choice.
For now that's Typescript Interfaces but Python is in the works, leveraging Data classes.
We don't currently support all of Typescript schema modeling features, but we're working on it.

### `Key<T>`

The `Key<T>` type is a MooseJS-specific type that allows you to define a primary key for your data model.
This is a required field for all data models. It can be added to multiple columns if you have a composite key.

We are planning to add a moose helper package that will allow you to import the `Key` type from it. Right now,
you have to defined it in your project. It doesn't matter what the type of the key is.

When we are provioning the OLAP storage table, we will use the `Key` type to define the primary key of the table.
What a primary key means in that database will depend on the database you are using. For Clickhouse, it will be
the [primary key](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/mergetree#primary-keys-and-indexes-in-queries) of the table.

### Files

Data Models can be defined in any file with a `.ts` extension in your project's `datamodels` directory.
The name of the file is not important. You may also define multiple models in the same Typescript file.

## Supported Types

Here is the status of MooseJS support for various data types in Data Models:
| Clickhouse | Typescript | Moose |
|:---------- |:---------- |:------- |
| String | String | ✅ |
| Boolean | Boolean | ✅ |
| Int64 | Number | ✅ |
| Int256 | BigInt | ❌ |
| Float64 | Number | ✅ |
| Decimal | Number | ✅ |
| DateTime | Date | ✅ |
| Json | Object | ❌ |
| Bytes | bytes | ❌ |
| Enum | Enum | ✅ |
| Array | Array | ✅ |
| nullable | nullable | ✅ |

## Inspecting Your Model

Once you've created your model, you can inspect it along with the infrastructure that MooseJS automatically
generated for you by navigating to the console at http://localhost:3001.

Here you fill find a list of all your Data Models. You can click into any Data Model to see details about it,
to get information about the APIs/SDKs for that Data Model, and to directly query the data currently stored in
the Data Model (technically, the data stored in the database table associated with that Data Model).

## Test Your Model

When you create a model, MooseJS automatically creates an ingestion point to facilitate immediate data
testing. Send a sample payload to this endpoint using:

<Tabs items={['Single Data Sample', 'Batch Sample']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  ``` bash
  curl -X POST \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"eventId": "1234567890", "timestamp": "2019-01-01 00:00:01", "userId": "123456", "activityType":"click"}' \
    http://localhost:4000/ingest/UserActivity
  ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  ``` bash
  for i in {1..10}
  do
    curl -X POST \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"eventId": "$i", "timestamp": "2024-01-01 00:00:00", "userId": "1234", "activityType":"click"}' \
      http://localhost:4000/ingest/UserActivity
  done
  ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

## Next steps

You're all set to start sending data into your Moose application from upstream sources, and consuming
into downstream sources. Check out the next two sections of the docs for more details on Ingesting and
Consuming Data. To understand the impact of changes to your Data Model, refer to the
[Data Change Management](/building/dcm/intro) section of the docs.
