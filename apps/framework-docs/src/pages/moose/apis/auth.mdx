# API Authentication & Security

Secure your Moose deployment by configuring authentication for your API endpoints. Moose supports two authentication methods:

- [JWT (JSON Web Tokens)](#jwt-authentication) - For integration with existing identity providers
- [API Keys](#api-key-authentication) - For simple, static authentication

## Getting Started

1. Choose your authentication method
2. Generate tokens using `moose generate hash-token`
3. Configure your authentication in `moose.config.toml` or with environment variables
4. Send requests with `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header

## Authentication Methods

### JWT Authentication

Use JWT when you have an existing identity provider or want standard token-based authentication.

#### Configure in `moose.config.toml`

```toml filename=moose.config.toml
[jwt]
# Your JWT public key (PEM-formatted RSA public key)
secret = """
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEAy...
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----
"""
# Expected JWT issuer
issuer = "https://my-auth-server.com/"
# Expected JWT audience  
audience = "my-moose-app"
# Optional: Enforce JWT on all ingest APIs (default: false)
enforce_on_all_ingest_apis = false
# Optional: Enforce JWT on all Analytics APIs (default: false)
enforce_on_all_consumptions_apis = false
```

#### Configure with Environment Variables

You can also set these values as environment variables:

```bash filename=".env" copy
MOOSE_JWT_PUBLIC_KEY=your_jwt_public_key # PEM-formatted RSA public key (overrides `secret` in `moose.config.toml`)
MOOSE_JWT_ISSUER=your_jwt_issuer # Expected JWT issuer (overrides `issuer` in `moose.config.toml`)
MOOSE_JWT_AUDIENCE=your_jwt_audience # Expected JWT audience (overrides `audience` in `moose.config.toml`)
```

<Callout type="info">
  The `secret` field should contain your JWT **public key** used to verify signatures using RS256 algorithm.
</Callout>

### API Key Authentication

Use API keys for simple, static authentication scenarios.

#### Configure with Environment Variables

Set environment variables with **hashed** API keys:
```bash
# For ingest endpoints
export MOOSE_INGEST_API_KEY='your_pbkdf2_hmac_sha256_hashed_key'

# For analytics endpoints  
export MOOSE_CONSUMPTION_API_KEY='your_pbkdf2_hmac_sha256_hashed_key'

# For admin endpoints
export MOOSE_ADMIN_TOKEN='your_plain_text_token'
```

## Endpoint Types and Authentication Priority


### Ingest Endpoints

If both JWT (in the `[jwt]` table) and an API (`MOOSE_INGEST_API_KEY`) are configured, and you have `jwt.enforce_on_all_ingest_apis` set to `false` in your `moose.config.toml` (or its not set):

```toml filename="moose.config.toml"
[jwt]
enforce_on_all_ingest_apis = false
```

```env filename=".env" copy
MOOSE_INGEST_API_KEY='your_pbkdf2_hmac_sha256_hashed_key'
```

Then, when a request is made to an `/ingest` endpoint, the server will:

- First attempt JWT validation (RS256 signature check). 
- If that fails or is not applicable, it will then try to validate using the API key (PBKDF2 HMAC SHA256). 


If you have `enforce_on_all_ingest_apis` set to true in your `moose.config.toml`:

```toml filename="moose.config.toml"
[jwt]
enforce_on_all_ingest_apis = true
```

Then, only JWT will be accepted if JWT is configured.


### Analytics Endpoints

(Same as Ingest Endpoints, but for `/api` endpoints)

If both JWT (in the `[jwt]` table) and an API (`MOOSE_CONSUMPTION_API_KEY`) are configured, and you have `jwt.enforce_on_all_consumptions_apis` set to `false` in your `moose.config.toml` (or its not set):

```toml filename="moose.config.toml"
[jwt]
enforce_on_all_consumptions_apis = false
```

```bash filename=".env" copy
MOOSE_CONSUMPTION_API_KEY='your_pbkdf2_hmac_sha256_hashed_key'
```

Then, when a request is made to an `/api` endpoint, the server will:

- First attempt JWT validation (RS256 signature check). 
- If that fails or is not applicable, it will then try to validate using the API key (PBKDF2 HMAC SHA256). 

If you have `enforce_on_all_consumptions_apis` set to true in your `moose.config.toml`:

```toml filename="moose.config.toml"
[jwt]
enforce_on_all_consumptions_apis = true
```

Then, only JWT will be accepted if JWT is configured.


### Admin Endpoints
Admin Endpoint Authentication
Administrative endpoints in Moose (e.g., for managing deployments, viewing plans) also require authentication to prevent unauthorized access.

#### Configuration:

Admin authentication relies on a token that can be supplied in the following order of precedence:
- `--token` CLI Parameter: When using Moose CLI commands that interact with a remote admin endpoint (e.g., `moose remote plan --token <value>`), this parameter takes highest precedence. The value should be the plain-text Bearer token.
- `MOOSE_ADMIN_TOKEN` Environment Variable: You can set the `MOOSE_ADMIN_TOKEN` environment variable to the plain-text Bearer token.

```bash copy
MOOSE_ADMIN_TOKEN='your_generated_plain_text_token'
```

This is useful for CI/CD environments or scripts interacting with admin endpoints.

- Project Configuration File (moose.config.toml): You can specify a hashed admin API key in your `moose.config.toml` under the [authentication] table. This key is expected to be a PBKDF2 HMAC SHA256 hash, obtainable from the `moose generate hash-token` command.

```toml filename="moose.config.toml"
 
[authentication]
admin_api_key = "your_pbkdf2_hmac_sha256_hashed_key"
```
<Callout type="info" title="Storing Admin API Keys in Project Configuration File">
  Storing the `admin_api_key` (which is a PBKDF2 HMAC SHA256 hash) in your `moose.config.toml` file is an acceptable practice, even if the file is version-controlled. This is because the actual plain-text Bearer token (the secret) is not stored. The hash is computationally expensive to reverse, ensuring that your secret is not exposed in the codebase.
</Callout>

The Moose server running locally will use this key to protect its admin endpoints. Use the hashed key output from `moose generate hash-token` here.

#### How it Works:

- For CLI interactions with a remote server, the CLI will use the token from `--token` or `MOOSE_ADMIN_TOKEN`.
- The Moose server itself (when running `moose dev` or a deployed instance) protects its admin API routes (e.g., `/admin/plan`, `/admin/integrate-changes`) using the `admin_api_key` (a PBKDF2 HMAC SHA256 hash) from `moose.config.toml` (in the `[authentication]` table) or the `MOOSE_ADMIN_TOKEN` environment variable if the `moose.config.toml` key is not set. 
- The server expects the plain-text token in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header and will verify it against the stored hashed key using PBKDF2 HMAC SHA256.
- Use the `moose generate hash-token` command as described above to generate the plain-text token and its corresponding PBKDF2 HMAC SHA256 hashed version for `admin_api_key`.

## Token Generation

Generate tokens and hashed keys using the Moose CLI:

```bash
moose generate hash-token
```

**Output:**
- **ENV API Keys**: Hashed key for environment variables (e.g., `MOOSE_INGEST_API_KEY`, `MOOSE_CONSUMPTION_API_KEY`, `MOOSE_ADMIN_TOKEN`)
- **Bearer Token**: Plain-text token for client applications (e.g., `Authorization: Bearer <token>`)

<Callout type="info">
  Use the **hashed key** for environment variables and `moose.config.toml`. Use the **plain-text token** in your `Authorization: Bearer token` headers.
</Callout>

## Making Authenticated Requests

All authenticated requests require the `Authorization` header:

```bash
# Using curl
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your_token_here" \
     https://your-moose-instance.com/api/endpoint

# Using JavaScript
fetch('https://your-moose-instance.com/api/endpoint', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer your_token_here'
  }
})
```

## Security Best Practices

- **Use environment variables** for production deployments
- **Generate unique tokens** for different environments
- **Rotate tokens regularly** for enhanced security
- **Use JWT** when integrating with existing identity providers
- **Use API keys** for simple, internal applications

<Callout type="warning">
  Never commit plain-text tokens to version control. Use hashed keys in configuration files and environment variables for production.
