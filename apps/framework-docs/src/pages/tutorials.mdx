# Learn Moose

This tutorial will guide you on using Moose to build a real-time analytics service that tracks when users star your GitHub repository and derives insights about them. Moose is an open-source framework for prototyping and scaling data-intensive apps.

### System Architecture

The framework offers primitives that let you implement your application logic for data ingestion, processing, aggregation, and consumption. These primitives are implemented in a combination of pure TypeScript/Python and SQL. Moose interprets the application logic in your primitives to automatically manage and configure assets in your underlying infrastructure.

The purpose of this project is to help you to learn and get comfortable building with Moose. At a high level you will:

1. Create a new Moose project from scratch and define your first Moose primitive (a **Data Model**) to start **ingesting** sample data within minutes.
2. Configure GitHub to send live webhook notifications to your Moose application whenever someone stars your repository.
3. Implement a Moose **Streaming Function** to filter and enrich the raw webhook event data as it’s ingested.
4. Use Moose **Blocks** to create a view of the processed event data for further analysis.
5. Build **Consumption APIs to** surface insights about the programming languages the starrers use in their repositories.
6. Access and analyze these insights via an API Client.

### What You'll Build

By the end of this tutorial, you will have built an end-to-end data-intensive back-end service with all the infrastructure—an OLAP database, streaming buffer, task orchestrator, and ingestion/consumption APIs—using Moose primitives and a few lines of code.
