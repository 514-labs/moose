# Initialize a Block

## Using the CLI

To create a new Block, use the `moose block init` command. This will generate a `.ts` or `.py` file in the `/blocks` directory, and export an empty `Blocks` object for you to fill in.

For detailed information about the `moose block init` command, you can run the following in your terminal:

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
npx moose-cli block init --help

```

## Manual setup

You can also manually create a Block by creating a `.ts` or `.py` file in the `/blocks` directory. Inside this file, you'll need to manually import the `Blocks` type from `@514labs/moose-lib` and export an empty `Blocks` object for you to fill in:

```ts
import { Blocks } from "@514labs/moose-lib";

export default {
  setup: [
    // Array of SQL statements for setting up database resources
  ],
  teardown: [
    // Array of SQL statements for tearing down resources
  ],
} as Blocks;
```
