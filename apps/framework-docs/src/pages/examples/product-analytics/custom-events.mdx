# Tracking Custom Events

To start instrumenting your own custom events, follow these two key steps:

1. **Create a Data Model:** Define a new Data Model containing the properties you want to represent in your custom event.
2. **Instrument Your Application:** Implement tracking in your existing application to send the custom event data to the Moose ingestion infrastructure you just set up.

## Define a New Data Model

For client-side events, we recommend beginning with the global properties found in the [`PageViewRaw` model](). From there, you can then add custom properties relevant to the specific events you want to track.

### Example: Button Click Event

If you want to track button click events, you could create a `ButtonClickEvent` Data Model with the following additional properties:

- `cta_copy` (the text on the button clicked)
- `cta_target` (the target link redirected by the button).

Add this `ButtonClickEvent` Data Model to your `models.ts` file:

```ts filename="moose/app/datamodels/models.ts" copy
export interface ButtonClickEvent extends PageViewRaw {
    cta_copy   String // Text on the button clicked
    cta_target String // Target link redirected by the button
}

```

<Callout>
  The `extends PageViewRaw` approach ensures you capture both the context (via
  common web analytics data fields) and the specific user interaction details
  for the event.
</Callout>

### Save Your Changes

Moose will configure the same infrastructure components you already have for the `PageViewRaw`, but this time these components are typed to the schema for the new `ButtonClickEvent` model.

Validate that Moose configured all the infrastructure for you by opening a new terminal window and running the following command:

```bash filename="terminal" copy
npx moose-cli ls
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Make sure you are in the `moose` project directory and your dev server is
  running (`moose dev`)
</Callout>

## Sending Custom Events

  <Tabs.Tab>
  If your custom event is being instrumented from the client side of your web app, you can leverage the `script.js` that is already integrated into your application.

#### Example: Tracking Button Click Events

Add the following code to the `onClick()` event handler for the button you want to track:

```tsx filename="Your Web App Client Code" copy
window.MooseAnalytics.trackEvent("ButtonClickEvent", {
  cta_copy: button_text, // Dynamically capture the button text
  cta_target: target_href, // Capture the target URL
});
```

### Key Points

- The first argument to `trackEvent()` corresponds to the data model name, ensuring the right model is used for transmitting your data to Moose.
- The second argument is an object that includes the properties unique to the `ButtonClickEvent`, as specified in your data model.
- The integrated script enriches the event data with common web analytics properties defined in the `PageViewRaw` model. This means you do not need to manually set these properties, as they are automatically appended to your event data payload in the tracking script.
