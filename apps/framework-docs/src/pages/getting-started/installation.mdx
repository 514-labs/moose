# Installation
You will need the following dependencies installed on your machine before you can use MooseJS:
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- macOS or Linux (Windows is not supported at this time)

## Quick Start

#### Start a new MooseJS project

The easiest way to get started with a new MooseJS application is to use `create-moose-app`. This will automatically create a project folder for you, and initialize a skeleton MooseJS app with the entire project structure you need to get started.
```txt filename="Terminal" copy
npx create-moose-app my-app
```

#### Run your new MooseJS app in Dev Mode

MooseJS comes with a handy CLI for managing your MooseJS application. You can run the CLI via NPX, or see below for how to install the CLI. Use the CLI now to start your new application in Development mode -- navigate to your project folder and run:
```txt filename="Terminal" copy
npx @514labs/moose-cli dev
```

Now you can visit [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view your new MooseJS application console. As you develop your MooseJS application, changes you make to your code base will be automatically reflected here in real time. Now try [creating your first data model](/building/model-data)!

## Install the Moose CLI

Instead of running the MooseJS CLI via NPX, you can also also install globally using NPM. This will get you a cleaner command interface, and better performance on the CLI.
```txt filename="Terminal" copy
npm install -g @514labs/moose-cli
```

Now instead of `npx @514labs/moose-cli [command]`, you can just use `moose [command]`.
