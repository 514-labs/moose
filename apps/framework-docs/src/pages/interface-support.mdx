# Typescript Interfaces as Data models
Moose enables you to model your data using Typescript interfaces. This is a powerful feature that allows you to define your data models in a single place and use them throughout your application. 


## A basic data model
```typescript filename="userEvent.m.ts"
import { Key } from 'moose-utils';

export interface UserActivityEvent {
    id: string & Key;
    userId: string;
    type: 'login' | 'logout';
    timestamp: Date;
}
```

There are a few things to note here:
- We are using the `Key` type from `moose-utils` to define the `id` field. This is a special type that is used to define primary keys in Moose.
- We are using the `&` operator to define the `id` field as a string and a `Key`. This is feature enables you to tell moose the specific type of your key.


## Enum support
Moose supports enums as well. You can use enums in your data models and Moose will handle them correctly.

```typescript filename="userEvent.m.ts"
import { Key } from 'moose-utils';

export enum UserActivityEventType {
    Login = 'login',
    Logout = 'logout'
}

export interface UserActivityEvent {
    id: string & Key;
    userId: string;
    type: UserActivityEventType;
    timestamp: Date;
}
```

## Extending data models
You can extend data models as well. This is useful when you have a base data model that you want to extend with additional fields.

```typescript filename="userEvent.m.ts"
import { Key } from 'moose-utils';

export enum UserActivityEventType {
    Login = 'login',
    Logout = 'logout'
}

export interface UserActivityEvent {
    id: string & Key;
    userId: string;
    type: UserActivityEventType;
    timestamp: Date;
}

export interface UserLoginEvent extends UserActivityEvent {
    ipAddress: string;
}
```

## Relations
Moose supports relations between data models. You can define relations between data models and Moose will handle them correctly.

```typescript filename="userEvent.m.ts"
import { Key } from 'moose-utils';

export enum UserActivityEventType {
    AddtoCart = 'addtocart',
    Checkout = 'checkout',
}

interface PurchasedProduct {
    productId: string & Key;
    quantity: number;
    price: number;
    style: string;
}

export interface UserActivityEvent {
    id: string & Key;
    userId: string;
    type: UserActivityEventType;
    timestamp: Date;
}

export interface UserCartEvent extends UserActivityEvent {
    cartId: string;
    product: PurchasedProduct;
}
```

This will automatically create a relation between `UserCartEvent` and `PurchasedProduct` as well as the associated foreign keys between the two data models. In order to defined the relation, you need to have a `Key` assigned to a field in both the parent and the child data models.

## Limitations
- Moose does not support circular references between data models. This is a limitation of the underlying database and not Moose itself.
- Moose does not support relations between data models that are in different files. We are working on a solution for this and will update the documentation once it is available.
- Moose doesn't support every every type that is available in Typescript. We are working on adding support for more types and will update the documentation once it is available.
- We currently map your interface type to a sane default type in the database. We are working on adding support for custom type mapping.
