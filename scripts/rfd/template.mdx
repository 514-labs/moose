Feel free to remove sections that aren't relevant to your RFD and add sections if necessary. The goal below is to seed what a good RFD should look like, if some sections
that you don't include are relevant to your RFD, the maintainers will ask you to add them in the pull request.

## Objective

What are we doing and why? What problem will this solve? What are the goals and
non-goals? This is your executive summary; keep it short, elaborate below.

## User Benefit

How will users (or other contributors) benefit from this work? What would be the headline in the release notes or blog post?

## Design Proposal

This is the meat of the document, where you explain your proposal. If you have
multiple alternatives, be sure to use sub-sections for better separation of the
idea, and list pros/cons to each approach. If there are alternatives that you
have eliminated, you should also list those here, and explain why you believe
your chosen approach is superior.

Make sure you’ve thought through and addressed the following sections. If a section is not relevant to your specific proposal, please explain why, e.g. your RFC addresses a convention or process, not an API.

### Alternatives Considered

- Make sure to discuss the relative merits of alternatives to your proposal.

### Performance Implications

- Do you expect any (speed / memory)? How will you confirm?
- There should be microbenchmarks. Are there?
- There should be end-to-end tests and benchmarks. If there are not (since this is still a design), how will you track that these will be created?

### Dependencies

- Dependencies: does this proposal add any new dependencies to the Moose?
- Dependent projects: are there other areas of the Moose or things that use Moose that this affects? How have you identified these dependencies and are you sure they are complete? If there are dependencies, how are you managing those changes?

### Engineering Impact

- Do you expect changes to binary size / startup time / build time / test times?
- Who will maintain this code? Is this code in its own buildable unit? Can this code be tested in its own? Is visibility suitably restricted to only a small API surface for others to use?

### Platforms and Environments

- Platforms: does this work on all platforms supported by Moose? If not, why is that ok?
- Execution environments (Cloud services, accelerator hardware): what impact do you expect and how will you confirm?

### Best Practices

- Does this proposal change best practices for some aspect of using/developing ? How will these changes be communicated/enforced?

### Tutorials and Examples

- If design changes existing API or creates new ones, the design owner should create end-to-end examples (ideally, a tutorial) which reflects how new feature will be used. Some things to consider related to the tutorial:
  - The minimum requirements for this are to consider how this would be used in a Keras-based workflow, as well as a non-Keras (low-level) workflow. If either isn’t applicable, explain why.
  - It should show the usage of the new feature in an end to end example (from data ingestion to consumption, if applicable). Many new features have unexpected effects in parts far away from the place of change that can be found by running through an end-to-end example.
  - This should be written as if it is documentation of the new feature, i.e., consumable by a user, not a Moose developer.
  - The code does not need to work (since the feature is not implemented yet) but the expectation is that the code does work before the feature can be merged.

### User Impact

- What are the user-facing changes? How will this feature be rolled out?

## Detailed Design

This section is optional. Elaborate on details if they’re important to
understanding the design, but would make it hard to read the proposal section
above.

## Questions and Discussion Topics

Seed this with open questions you require feedback on from the RFD process.
