# Introduction

Data Models are the backbone of your Moose application, enabling you to define the schemas for the data your application supports. Moose takes these definitions and automatically configures the entire data infrastructure, including:

- **Typed SDK**: Captures data from upstream data sources or producers
- **Ingestion API Endpoint**: Receives data from upstream sources, including but not limited to the SDK
- **Streaming Topic**: Buffers incoming data from the ingestion server, handling peak loads without data loss
- **Database Landing Table**: Stores ingested data in a structured format
- **Database View**: Facilitates access and querying of the underlying data

Each component is strongly typed and kept in sync with the Data Model schema defined in your Moose application's source code.

## Data Modeling Conventions

Data Models must be placed in the `/datamodels` directory of your Moose application. The directory structure should look like this:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="app" open>
    <FileTree.Folder name="datamodels" open>
      <FileTree.File name="models.ts" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.Folder name="..." />
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

Data Models are represented using native features and syntax of the language you are using:

- **TypeScript**: Data Models are represented as `interfaces`, and must be exported from a `.ts` file (using `export` keyword)
- **Python**: Data Models are represented as `dataclasses` (using the `@dataclass` decorator), and must be defined in a `.py` file

<Callout>
  Notes:
  <ul>
    <li> You can define multiple Data Models within a single file. </li>
    <li>
      The name of the file is not important, but it must have a `.ts` or `.py`
      extension.{" "}
    </li>
    <li>
      {" "}
      Any exported interface or dataclass that adheres to the appropriate file and
      folder conventions will be automatically detected by Moose and used to generate
      the necessary infrastructure.
    </li>
  </ul>
</Callout>

### Example Data Model in TypeScript

```ts filename="datamodels/models.ts" copy
import { Key } from "@514labs/moose-lib";

export interface UserActivity {
  eventId: Key<string>;
  timestamp: string;
  userId: string;
  activity: string;
}
```
