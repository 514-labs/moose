# Getting Started with Moose

<Callout type="warning" title="Run Docker">
  Open Docker Desktop if its not already running. <br /> Don't have it
  installed? [Download Docker
  here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
</Callout>


<Steps>
### Create an Empty Moose Project

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
npx create-moose-app@latest moose-github-analytics ts --empty
```

This Moose CLI helper function creates a new Moose app with the proper conventions for the basic directory structure. This includes an `/app` folder which contains the heart of your new Moose app. Each sub-folder hosts one type of Moose primitive.

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder open name="moose-github-analytics">
    <FileTree.Folder open name="app">
      <FileTree.Folder name="datamodels" />
      <FileTree.Folder name="functions" />
      <FileTree.Folder name="blocks" />
      <FileTree.Folder name="apis" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

### `cd` into your Moose Project and Install Dependencies

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
cd moose-github-analytics && npm install
```

### Run the Moose Development Server

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
moose-cli dev
```

<Callout type="warning">
  You must be in your project directory in order to start the development server
</Callout>

You should expect to see the following printed to your terminal:

<ZoomImg src="/moose-dev-terminal.png" />



<Callout type="success">
  You have set up a Moose instance at `http://localhost:4000`
  
  <br/><br/>

It provides the following infrastructure:

  <ul>
    - **OLAP Database** (Clickhouse) to store and analyze your data 
    - **Streaming Data Platform** (Redpanda) to buffer and transform incoming data
    - **Ingestion and Consumption APIs** to get data in and out of your database
  </ul>
<br/>
As you develop, the dev server automatically updates with your latest changes, providing a real-time view of your Moose application locally.
</Callout>

### Open Project in IDE

With VSCode, for example:

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
code .
```

<Callout type="info" title="(VSCode) Install Recommended Extensions ">
  Click '**Install**' on the pop-up window located in the bottom right corner of
  the screen. Moose will automatically configure these extensions for you.
</Callout>

<ZoomImg src="/vscode-install.png" />
</Steps>
