# Brain Data Analysis



## Overview

This analysis covers brain movement data from three distinct sessions labeled \"Meditation,\" \"Coding,\" and \"Exercise.\" The data consists of accelerometer and gyroscope movement scores along with their total movement scores calculated for each session.



## Session Analysis



### 1. Meditation

- **Session ID:** 1735843459

- **Acc Movement Score:** 27,739.71

- **Gyro Movement Score:** 251,689.59

- **Total Movement Score:** 279,429.30



**Analysis:**  

The \"Meditation\" session exhibits relatively low movement scores compared to other activities. This is expected as meditation typically involves minimal physical movement. The movement scores reflect subtle shifts, likely associated with small postural adjustments or breathing movements. 



### 2. Coding

- **Session ID:** 1735843609

- **Acc Movement Score:** 27,063.12

- **Gyro Movement Score:** 438,485.58

- **Total Movement Score:** 465,548.71



**Analysis:**  

During the \"Coding\" session, the movement scores increase moderately, with a significant rise in the gyroscopic movement score. This suggests more frequent or vigorous subtle movements, possibly linked to concentrated activities involving typing or small head movements as users interact with screens and keyboard.



### 3. Exercise

- **Session ID:** 1735843763

- **Acc Movement Score:** 28,739.11

- **Gyro Movement Score:** 2,332,955.06

- **Total Movement Score:** 2,361,694.16



**Analysis:**  

The \"Exercise\" session demonstrates the highest movement scores, especially notable with the gyroscope. This is indicative of physical activity involving full-body movements which are naturally more dynamic and intensive. The significant movement indicates the probable execution of a high-intensity workout or sports-related activities.



## Comparative Analysis

Among the sessions, the \"Exercise\" activity displays drastically higher movement scores, distinguishing it from the sedentary and less dynamic \"Meditation\" and \"Coding\" activities. The \"Meditation\" session records the lowest movement scores, aligning with its nature of tranquility. \"Coding\" falls in between, reflecting the activity's semi-stationary yet mentally engaging demands.



## Conclusion

These movement scores provide insights into the physical demands and characteristics associated with each labeled activity. Understanding the variance in movement may help develop strategies for optimizing focus, task performance, or relaxation depending on the session context.
