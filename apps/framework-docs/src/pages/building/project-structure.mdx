# Project Structure
MooseJS relies heavily on structural conventions to make sure you can build quickly and reliably. That means the project structure is important.


The following is the basic structure of a MooseJS project:
 
<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name=".moose"  />
  <FileTree.Folder name="app" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="datamodels" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.File name="model.prisma" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.Folder name="flows" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.Folder name="sourceModel" defaultOpen>
          <FileTree.Folder name="destinationModel" defaultOpen>
            <FileTree.File name="flow.ts" />
          </FileTree.Folder>
        </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
  <FileTree.File name="package.json" />
  <FileTree.File name="project.toml" />
</FileTree>

## Top-level Folders and Files
|  |  |
| ------ | ----------- |
| app | The main folder for your application. |
| .moose | Moose internals. You shouldn't ever have to touch anything in here. |
| package.json | Configuration file for your application. |
| project.toml | Configuration file for your application. |

## App folders
|  |  |
| ------ | ----------- |
| datamodels | The folder where you define your [Data Models](https://docs.moosejs.com/building/model-data). |
| flows | The folder where you define your [Flows](https://docs.moosejs.com/building/flows) - note that the hierarchy of folders here dictates the routing and orchestration of your flows. |
