# Workflow Configuration

## Overview
Simple yet powerful configuration system using TOML files to define workflow behavior, scheduling, resource requirements, and alerting preferences.

## Configuration Structure

### Basic Configuration
```toml
# Basic workflow settings
name = "daily-etl"
schedule = "0 0 * * *"
retries = 3
timeout = "1h"

# Alert configuration
[alerts]
on_failure = ["slack-channel", "email-team"]

# Resource requirements
[resources]
memory = "4Gi"
cpu = 2

# Environment variables
[env]
POSTGRES_URL = "${POSTGRES_URL}"
```

## Features

## Advanced Configuration

### Workflow Dependencies
```toml
[dependencies]
upstream = ["workflow-a", "workflow-b"]
downstream = ["workflow-c"]

[conditions]
wait_for_upstream = true
timeout = "2h"
```

### Performance Tuning
```toml
[performance]
batch_size = 1000
parallel_steps = 4
memory_limit = "8Gi"
temp_storage = "20Gi"
```

### Monitoring Settings
```toml
[monitoring]
metrics = true
tracing = true
log_level = "info"
retention = "30d"
```
