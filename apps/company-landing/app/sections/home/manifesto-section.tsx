            To do anything interesting with data, you have immerse yourself in a
            whole specialized ecosystem of solutions: from storage (e.g.
            snowflake, s3), to streaming (e.g. kafka), to processing (eg. spark,
            python scripts), to ingest (eg. fivetran, airbyte), to modeling (eg.
            dbt), to orchestration (eg. airflow). You have to hire as many data
            engineers as you can manage. You have to create data models, tables,
            views, topics, jobs, scripts, connectors, APIs, and SDKs - and then
            string them all together to play nicely in production. And good luck
            when something changes upstream, or you have to hand off across
            teams.

            This isn&apos;t how modern software development is supposed to be!
            By comparison, developing web applications and services looks like
            rainbows and roses. Software developers don&apos;t manage fragmented
            components in isolation and cross their fingers, hoping everything
            plays nicely. They create holistic applications, with contracts
            between microservices. They don&apos;t manually configure in
            production and in the cloud, spinning plates to keep everything
            alive. They write code in their local IDE. They use frameworks that
            abstract away infrastructure and middleware complexity. They
            leverage decades of software best practices for speed, quality and
            collaboration - like version control, CI/CD, automated testing,
            change management, and DevOps.

            Why should development on a data/analytics stack be any different?
            It shouldn&apos;t be!

            Our mission at Fiveonefour is to bring incredible developer
            experiences to the data stack. We believe that we&apos;ll have
            accomplished this when data or analytics can be dropped from the
            title of the people using data platforms. When data engineers are
            just engineers. When data services are just another software service
            - written in code, powered by microservices and frameworks, and
            managed with software best practices. When every developer can
            deliver high-quality data products, derive insights for themselves
            and their stakeholders, and easily integrate predictive and
            generative AI. When becoming data-driven is second nature, and ROI
            on data investments is nearly guaranteed.
