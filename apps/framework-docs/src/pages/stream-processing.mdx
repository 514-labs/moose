# Introduction to Streaming Functions

Streaming Functions in Moose enable real-time data processing, allowing you to transform, enrich, filter, or trigger actions based on incoming data. These powerful functions can:

- Map data between Data Models
- Enrich data with external information
- Filter out unwanted data
- Implement arbitrary logic to handle and respond to incoming data

They are defined as regular functions in TypeScript or Python files, and are executed in real-time as data flows into your Moose application.

## Core Concepts

Streaming Functions act as intermediares between two Data Models: a source and a destination. They are automatically triggered when new data arrives on the source Data Model's streaming topic. These functions transform the incoming data and output it in a format that matches the destination Data Model's schema.

##### Key points:

1. **Input**: Data from the source Data Model's streaming topic
2. **Processing**: Custom logic defined in the Streaming Function
3. **Output**: Data conforming to the destination Data Model's schema
4. **Execution**: Automatic and real-time, triggered by new messages to the source Data Model's streaming topic

### File and Folder Conventions

Streaming Functions are defined in files within the `/functions` directory of your Moose app, following this naming pattern:

- `SourceDataModel__DestinationDataModel.ts` (for TypeScript)
- `SourceDataModel__DestinationDataModel.py` (for Python)

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="my-moose-app" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="functions" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name="SourceDataModel__DestinationDataModel.ts" />
      <FileTree.File name="AnotherSource__AnotherDestination.py" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

<Callout type="warning" title="Naming Convention">
  Use two underscores to separate the source and destination data models in the
  file name. This convention allows Moose to automatically identify and execute
  the Streaming Functions.
</Callout>

### Streaming Function Definition

<Tabs.Tab>
In TypeScript, a Streaming Function is defined as the default export of its module:

```ts filename="/functions/SourceDataModel__DestinationDataModel.ts" copy
import { SourceDataModel } from "../datamodels/path/to/SourceDataModel";
import { DestinationDataModel } from "../datamodels/path/to/DestinationDataModel";

export default function functionName(
  source: SourceDataModel,
): DestinationDataModel[] | DestinationDataModel | null {
  // Transformation logic
}
```

The function accepts a single parameter `source` of type `SourceDataModel`. This is the data that Moose will pass to the function when it receives a new message on the streaming topic associated with the source Data Model.

The return type can be:

- An array of `DestinationDataModel` objects
- A single `DestinationDataModel` object
- `null` if no output should be produced

The function body contains the processing logic. We will go into more detail on this in the next section.

  The function name itself is not important, as Moose identifies the function by
  the file convention.

In Python, a Streaming Function is defined as a `Flow` object with a `run` attribute that is assigned the function:

```python filename="/functions/SourceDataModel__DestinationDataModel.py" copy
from app.datamodels.models import SourceDataModel, DestinationDataModel
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Callable


@dataclass
class Flow:
  run: Callable


def function_name(source: SourceDataModel) -> DestinationDataModel:
    # Transformation logic
    pass

my_flow = Flow(
    run=function_name
)

```

- The `Flow` object is how Moose identifies the entry point for the Streaming Function.
- The `run` attribute is assigned the function that Moose will call when it receives a new message on the streaming topic associated with the source Data Model.

- The function accepts a single parameter `source` of type `SourceDataModel`. This is the data that Moose will pass to the function when it receives a new message on the streaming topic associated with the source Data Model.

- The return type is `DestinationDataModel`. If a value is returned Moose automatically serializes it to JSON and writes it to the streaming topic associated with the destination Data Model.

<Callout type="info" title="What About the Function Name?">
  The function name itself is not important, as Moose identifies the function by
  whatever is assigned to the `run` attribute of the Flow object.
