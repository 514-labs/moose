# In-Database Transformations

<LanguageSwitcher />

## Overview
Materialized views allow you to precompute and store the results of complex queries. This can be useful for improving query performance, reducing the load on your database, and providing a more efficient way to access data.

### Basic Example

<TypeScript>
```ts filename="MaterializedView.ts" copy
import { MaterializedView, sql } from "@514labs/moose-lib";

// 1. Define the schema of the materialized view result set
interface TargetSchema {
  id: string;
  average_rating: number;
  num_reviews: number;
}

// 2. Write a SELECT query to compute the result set
const exampleMaterializedView = new MaterializedView<TargetSchema>({
  selectStatement: sql` SELECT * FROM source_table_name`,
  tableName: "my_table",
  materializedViewName: "example_materialized_view",
});
```
</TypeScript>

<Python>
```py filename="MaterializedView.py" copy
from moose_lib import MaterializedView, sql

# 1. Define the schema of the materialized view result set
class TargetSchema(BaseModel):
    id: str
    average_rating: float
    num_reviews: int

# 2. Write a SELECT query to compute the result set
example_materialized_view = MaterializedView[TargetSchema](
    select_statement=f"SELECT * FROM source_table_name",
    table_name="my_table",
    materialized_view_name="example_materialized_view",
)
```
</Python>

### Configuration Options

<TypeScript>
```typescript filename="ViewOptions.ts"
interface MaterializedViewOptions<T> {
  selectStatement: string; // sql query to compute the materialized view
  tableName: string; // name of the table where materialized view result set will be stored
  materializedViewName: string; // name of the materialized view in the database

  engine?: ClickHouseEngines; // default is MergeTree
  orderByFields?: (keyof T & string)[]; // default is the primary key of the source table
}
```
</TypeScript>

<Python>
```python filename="ViewOptions.py" copy
from moose_lib import MaterializedView, sql
from source_table import source_table

class MaterializedViewOptions(BaseModel):
    select_statement: str
    table_name: str
    materialized_view_name: str
    engine: ClickHouseEngines = ClickHouseEngines.MergeTree
    order_by_fields: List[str] = []
```
</Python>

## Working with Aggregations

<TypeScript>
Materialized views support aggregations using the `Aggregated` type in your schema definition and the `AggregatingMergeTree` engine. This is crucial for efficiently maintaining pre-aggregated data in real-time systems.

<Python>
Materialized views support aggregations using the `Annotated` type in your schema definition and the `AggregatingMergeTree` engine. This is crucial for efficiently maintaining pre-aggregated data in real-time systems.

### Why Use ClickHouse Aggregate Functions

ClickHouse's aggregate functions offer several advantages when used in materialized views:

1. **Incremental computation**: ClickHouse can update aggregations incrementally when new data arrives, rather than recomputing the entire result set
2. **Memory efficiency**: Aggregate states are stored in a compact format optimized for the specific function
3. **High performance**: Native implementation of complex statistical functions that scale with your data volume
<TypeScript>
4. **Type safety**: The `Aggregated<T>` type in Moose ensures correct mapping between TypeScript and ClickHouse aggregation types
</TypeScript>

When using the `AggregatingMergeTree` engine, ClickHouse maintains the state of your aggregations between updates, making it much more efficient than re-aggregating from raw data each time.

### Common Aggregate Functions

<TypeScript>
Some of the most useful aggregate functions for materialized views include:


| Function | Description | TypeScript Usage |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| `sum` | Sum of values | `number & Aggregated<"sum">` |
| `avg` | Average of values | `number & Aggregated<"avg">` |
| `count` | Count of records | `number & Aggregated<"count">` |
| `uniq` | Approximate unique count | `number & Aggregated<"uniq">` |
| `min` | Minimum value | `number & Aggregated<"min">` |
| `max` | Maximum value | `number & Aggregated<"max">` |
</TypeScript>


### Aggregation Example

<TypeScript>
```ts filename="Aggregations.ts" copy
import { MaterializedView, ClickHouseEngines } from "@514labs/moose-lib";
import { sourceTable } from "./SourceTable";

interface TargetSchema {
  id: string;
  average_rating: number & Aggregated<"avg">;
  num_reviews: number & Aggregated<"sum">;
}

const query = sql`
  SELECT 
    ${sourceTable.columns["id"]}, 
    AVG(${sourceTable.columns["rating"]}) as average_rating, 
    COUNT(${sourceTable.columns["id"]}) as num_reviews 
  FROM ${sourceTable.name}
  GROUP BY ${sourceTable.columns["id"]}
  `;

const exampleMaterializedView = new MaterializedView<TargetSchema>({
  selectStatement: query,
  tableName: "my_table",
  materializedViewName: "example_materialized_view",
  engine: ClickHouseEngines.AggregatingMergeTree, 
  orderByFields: ["id"],
});
```
</TypeScript>

### Best Practices for Aggregations

When working with aggregated materialized views:

1. **Choose the right engine**: Always use `AggregatingMergeTree` for views with aggregate functions
2. **Match schema to query**: Ensure your TargetSchema fields match the aggregate functions in your query
3. **Consider data volume**: Aggregations are most valuable for large datasets where full scans are expensive
4. **Group wisely**: Be thoughtful about your GROUP BY clauses as they affect both storage and query patterns
5. **Combine with filtering**: Pre-filter data in your select statement to improve performance

When these practices are followed, materialized views with aggregations can provide dramatic performance improvements for analytical queries while maintaining near real-time data freshness.

## Querying Materialized Views

You can query materialized views just like any other table in Moose:

<TypeScript>
```ts filename="QueryingMaterializedView.ts" copy
const query = sql`SELECT * FROM ${exampleMaterializedView.targetTable.name}`;
```
</TypeScript>

<Python>

</Python>

## How It Works

When you create a materialized view in Moose:

1. A new table is automatically created in your database using the provided schema
2. The `selectStatement` is used to compute the initial results
3. The results are stored in the new table
4. In ClickHouse, materialized views function as triggers on the source table
5. Whenever new data is inserted into the source table, the materialized view automatically updates
6. The update uses the <TypeScript inline>`selectStatement`</TypeScript><Python inline>`select_statement`</Python> to compute the latest results from the source data

This ensures your precomputed views stay in sync with your underlying data without manual intervention.
