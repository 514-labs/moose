### Prerequisites

Check that [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) are installed:

```bash
docker --version && node --version
```

## A. Set Up Moose

<aside>
⚠️ **Make sure Docker is running:**

- Open Docker Desktop if it is not already running.
- Validate it is running:

```bash
docker info
```

You’ll see a bunch of info from docker, and it should run without an error.

</aside>

1. Install the `moose` CLI:

```bash
npm install -g @514labs/moose-cli@0.3.530
```

1. Validate the CLI is installed:

```bash
moose --version
```

### Create a Moose Application

1. Create a new Moose app called `moose-github-analytics`:

   ```bash
   moose init moose-github-analytics --empty
   ```

   This is a helper function to create a new Moose app with the proper conventions for the basic directory structure. This includes an `/app` folder which contains the heart of your new Moose app, with each sub-folder containing one type of Moose primitive. The `--empty` flag signals not to include any example primitives in the project — so you’ll really start from scratch on this tutorial.

   ```
   .
   └── moose-github-analytics/
       └── app/
           ├── aggreations
           ├── apis
           ├── datamodels
           └── functions
   ```

2. `cd` into your Moose project and install dependencies. The command below will do both.

   ```bash
   cd moose-github-analytics && npm install
   ```

3. Run the Moose development server from **your project directory**:

   ```bash
   moose dev
   ```

   <aside>
ℹ️ This sets up a Moose instance at `http://localhost:4000`, which provides the following infrastructure:

   - an OLAP database (Clickhouse) to store and analyze your data
   - a streaming data platform (Redpanda) to buffer and transform incoming data
   - an ingestion and consumption API endpoint to `POST` data in and `GET` data out from your OLAP database.

   As you write code for your Moose project, this dev server will automatically hot-swap in the latest code, so you can see your entire Moose application running locally as you develop.

   </aside>

   You should expect to see the following in your terminal. This is now your active Moose Server.

### Open Project in your IDE

For example, for VSCode users:

```bash
code .
```

- **VSCode Users**: Install the recommended extensions in the pop-up window. **Click ‘Install’** on this popup in the bottom right.
