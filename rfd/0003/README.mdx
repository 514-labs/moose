title: Data Ingestion
state: implemented

## Context

Data ingestion in the Moose ecosystem is handled by a Rust binary, the `framework-cli`, which exposes an HTTP
server typically listening on port 4000. Users define data models within their Moose project. These definitions
implicitly create corresponding ingest endpoints.

The standard path for these endpoints follows the pattern: `/ingest/<data_model_name>/<version>`.
Data is sent to these endpoints via `POST` requests. The supported data formats for ingestion are `JSON`
and `JsonArray`. The `moose ls` command can be used to list all available ingest routes in a project.

## Authentication

The ingest endpoints are secured and support multiple authentication mechanisms:

1.  **Bearer Token Authentication**: Clients can authenticate by providing a Bearer token in the `Authorization`
    header.

2.  **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**:
    *   If JWT authentication is configured for the project, the Bearer token is treated as a JWT.
    *   Validation is performed using a configured public key, issuer, and audience.
    *   The `JwtConfig` in the project settings (typically `moose.yaml` or environment variables) stores these
      details.

3.  **API Key**:
    *   Alternatively, a simpler API key mechanism can be used.
    *   The `MOOSE_INGEST_API_KEY` environment variable (or a corresponding project configuration) holds the
      secret key.
    *   The provided Bearer token is then validated against this key using PBKDF2 HMAC SHA256.
    *   The `moose generate hash-token` command can be used to generate compatible tokens and keys.

The `framework-cli` checks the `Authorization` header for a `Bearer` token and validates it using the
configured JWT settings or the `MOOSE_INGEST_API_KEY`.

## Data Flow

Upon successful authentication and request validation, the `framework-cli` ingests the data.
The primary action is to publish the received data messages to a specific stream (topic) in Redpanda.
Downstream processes, such as data transformation jobs or real-time analytics, can then consume the data
from these Redpanda topics. The specifics of these downstream processes are outside the scope of this
ingestion RFD.
