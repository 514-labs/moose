# Define a Data Model to Ingest Data from the Github Webhook

<LanguageSwitcher />

Now you’re ready to define your first Moose primitive: a **Data Model**. This primitive is where you specify the schema of the data you will use in your application. Let's create a `RawStarEvent` Data Model for the data we will receive from the GitHub webhook.

## Initialize a Data Model from Sample Data via the CLI

Instead of creating your Data Model by hand, let’s use the Moose helper function that can automatically generate Data Models based on analyzing a set of sample data.

<Steps>

### Add Sample Data to your Project

Create a new file named `sample-data.json` in the root folder of your project:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.File name="sample-data.json" />
  <FileTree.Folder name="app" open>
    <FileTree.Folder name="datamodels" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="functions" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="blocks" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="apis" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

Inside this file, paste in the following sample data and save your changes:

<ToggleBlock openText="Expand to Copy Sample Data" closeText="Collapse Sample Data">
```json filename="sample-data.json" copy

### Initialize a `RawStarEvent` Data Model via the CLI

<Callout type="info">
  Start a new terminal session and make sure to navigate back to your project
  directory.
</Callout>

<TypeScript>
```bash filename="Terminal" copy
npx moose-cli data-model init RawStarEvent -s sample-data.json
```
</TypeScript>

<Python>
```bash filename="Terminal" copy
moose-cli data-model init RawStarEvent -s sample-data.json
```
</Python>

This command will generate a new file named:<TypeScript NodeType="span">`RawStarEvent.ts`</TypeScript><Python NodeType="span">`RawStarEvent.py`</Python> and place it in the `datamodels` folder of your project.

<TypeScript>
<FileTree>
  <FileTree.File name="sample-data.json" />
  <FileTree.Folder name="app" open>
    <FileTree.Folder name="datamodels" open>
      <FileTree.File name="RawStarEvent.ts" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>
</TypeScript>

<Python>
<FileTree>
  <FileTree.File name="sample-data.json" />
  <FileTree.Folder name="app" open>
    <FileTree.Folder name="datamodels" open>
      <FileTree.File name="RawStarEvent.py" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>
</Python>

### Open and Inspect <TypeScript NodeType="span">`RawStarEvent.ts`</TypeScript><Python NodeType="span">`RawStarEvent.py`</Python>

Open the file Moose generated for you in your IDE to inspect the Data Model code that was automatically generated from the sample data.

<TypeScript>
Note a couple of interesting fields:

```ts filename="datamodels/RawStarEvent.ts" copy {4, 12, 15}
import { Key } from "@514labs/moose-lib";

export interface RawStarEvent {
  action: Key<string>;
  organization: {
    // more data fields ...
    //..
  };
  // more data fields ...
  // ...
  //...
  sender: {
    //...
  };
  starred_at: string;
}
```
</TypeScript>

<Python>
Scroll to the bottom of the file to see the `RawStarEvent` Data Model definition. This is decorated with the `@moose_data_model` decorator, which is required for Moose to recognize it as a Data Model:

```py filename="datamodels/RawStarEvent.py" copy
from moose_lib import Key, moose_data_model
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Optional

class RawStarEvent:
    action: Key[str]
    starred_at: Optional[str]
    repository: Repository
    organization: Organization
    sender: Sender
```
</Python>

- `action`: Indicates whether a star was `created` or `deleted` for this event.
- `starred_at`: For `created` actions, this field represents the timestamp when the star was added.
- `sender`: An object containing information about the user who starred or un-starred the repository. There are two fields within this nested object that we want to ingest:
  - `sender.login`: the username of the starrer
  - `sender.repos_url`: the URL we can use to lookup the starrer's public repositories

<Callout type="info" title="Data Modeling Tips:">
- Each Data Model must designate a field as the `Key` type. This special type, imported from <TypeScript NodeType="span">`@514labs/moose-lib`</TypeScript><Python NodeType="span">`moose_lib`</Python>, specifies the sorting key for your Clickhouse table.
- The <TypeScript NodeType="span">optional (`?`) operator</TypeScript><Python NodeType="span">`Optional[T]` type</Python> is used to mark a field as nullable (*i.e., it's possible for the field to be missing in the data you want to ingest*).
<TypeScript>
- Only **exported interfaces** are picked up as Data Models, and spin up corresponding Moose infrastructure.
</TypeScript>
<Python>
- Only the dataclasses decorated with `@moose_data_model` (imported from `moose_lib`) are picked up as Data Models, and spin up corresponding Moose infrastructure.
- Nested objects are defined as their own `@dataclass` but without the `@moose_data_model` decorator.
</Python>
</Callout>

### Verify Moose Configured the infrastructure

Your dev server should have automatically picked up on the new Data Model and configured the necessary infrastructure to ingest webhook events with this schema.

Run this command in your terminal to verify:

<TypeScript>
```bash filename="Terminal" copy
npx moose-cli ls
```
</TypeScript>

<Python>
```bash filename="Terminal" copy
moose-cli ls
```
</Python>


</Steps>
<Callout type="success">
  With just a single terminal command, you've generated a Moose Data Model. This
  Data Model in turn automatically generated:
  - An API route to ingest `RawStarEvent` data (`ingest/RawStarEvent`) 
  - A Redpanda streaming topic to queue and process the data 
  - A Clickhouse database table to store these events (`RawStarEvent_0_0`) 
</Callout>
