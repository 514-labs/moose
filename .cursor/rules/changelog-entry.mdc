# How to Create a New Changelog Entry from Recent Pull Requests

To create a new changelog entry, follow these steps:

1. **Review Recent Pull Requests**
   - Use the GitHub repository's Pull Requests page or the MCP server to list and review merged PRs since the last release.
   - For each PR, note the title, number, author, and a brief summary of the change.

2. **Assign a Version Tag for Each PR**
   - Every PR merged to main receives its own version tag.
   - Bump the most minor part of the version (the PATCH number in MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) for each PR (e.g., v1.3.0 → v1.3.1 → v1.3.2, etc.).
   - Use the date the PR was merged (released) in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD) for the release date.

3. **Structure the Changelog Entry**
   - For each PR, create a new changelog entry at the top of [index.mdx](mdc:apps/framework-docs/src/pages/changelog/index.mdx).
   - Follow the structure in [changelog-template.md](mdc:apps/framework-docs/src/components/md-templates/changelog-template.md) and [changelog-guide.md](mdc:apps/framework-docs/src/components/md-templates/changelog-guide.md):
     - Version and date
     - Release highlights
     - Added
     - Changed
     - Deprecated
     - Fixed
     - Security
     - Breaking changes

4. **Assign PRs to Sections**
   - Place the PR under the appropriate section (e.g., "Added" for new features, "Fixed" for bug fixes, "Security" for security improvements).
   - For each entry, include:
     - A brief description of the change
     - A link to the PR (e.g., [#1234](mdc:https:/github.com/514-labs/moose/pull/1234))
     - The contributor's GitHub handle (e.g., by [username](mdc:https:/github.com/username))

5. **Example Entry**
```
# v1.3.2 - 2025-05-21

## Release highlights
* Security headers added for improved security ([#2354](mdc:https:/github.com/514-labs/moose/pull/2354) by [callicles](mdc:https:/github.com/callicles))

## Security
* Added security headers ([#2354](mdc:https:/github.com/514-labs/moose/pull/2354) by [callicles](mdc:https:/github.com/callicles))

## Breaking changes
* None in this release
```

6. **Update the Changelog File**
   - Edit [index.mdx](mdc:apps/framework-docs/src/pages/changelog/index.mdx) to add the new entry at the top for each PR merged to main.
   - Ensure formatting and links are correct.

7. **Reference**
   - For detailed instructions and examples, see [changelog-template.md](mdc:apps/framework-docs/src/components/md-templates/changelog-template.md) and [changelog-guide.md](mdc:apps/framework-docs/src/components/md-templates/changelog-guide.md).
