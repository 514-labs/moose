# Moose Deploy

<LanguageSwitcher />

## Overview

Once you've finished developing your MooseStack Applications locally, the next step is to deploy your MooseStack Applications into production. You have two options:

- Self-host your MooseStack Applications on your own servers
- Use the [Boreal Cloud hosting platform](https://www.fiveonefour.com/boreal) (from the makers of the Moose Stack)

## Getting Started With Self-Hosting
Moose makes it easy to package and deploy your applications, whether you're deploying to a server with or without internet access. The deployment process is designed to be flexible and can accommodate both containerized and non-containerized environments.

### Deployment Options

1. **Kubernetes Deployment**: Deploy your application to Kubernetes clusters (GKE, EKS, AKS, or on-premises)
2. **Standard Server Deployment**: Deploy your application to a server with internet access
3. **Containerized Cloud Deployment**: Deploy to cloud services like AWS ECS or Google Cloud Run
4. **Offline Server Deployment**: Deploy to an environment without internet access

### Key Deployment Steps

There are three main aspects to deploying MooseStack Applications:

<TypeScript>
1. Setting up your build environment with Node.js and the Moose CLI
2. Building your application using `moose build`
3. Setting up your deployment environment with the necessary runtime dependencies (Node.js, Docker) and configuration
</TypeScript>

<Python>
1. Setting up your build environment with Python and the Moose CLI
2. Building your application using `moose build`
3. Setting up your deployment environment with the necessary runtime dependencies (Python, Docker) and configuration
</Python>


## Configuring Your Deployment

Based on our production experience, we recommend the following best practices for deploying MooseStack Applications:

### Health Monitoring

Configure comprehensive health checks to ensure your application remains available:
- Startup probes to handle initialization
- Readiness probes for traffic management
- Liveness probes to detect and recover from deadlocks

### Zero-Downtime Deployments

Implement graceful termination and rolling updates:
- Pre-stop hooks to handle in-flight requests
- Appropriate termination grace periods
- Rolling update strategies that maintain service availability

### Resource Allocation

Properly size your deployments based on workload:
- CPU and memory requests tailored to your application
- Replicas scaled according to traffic patterns
- Horizontal scaling for high availability

### Environment Configuration

For any deployment type, you'll need to configure:

1. Runtime environment variables for logging, telemetry, and application settings
2. External service connections (ClickHouse, Redpanda, Redis)
3. Network settings and security configurations
4. Application-specific configurations
