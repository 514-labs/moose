# Moose

>Data engineering framework for modern software developers

Moose is an open-source framework for building data-intensive applications using pure TypeScript or Python without the complexity of a traditional data stack.

## Why Moose Exists

### The DIY Data Stack Approach
What if you need to add a simple string field to your data model?

1. Update your TS/Python Code Model
2. Update your Database Schema
3. Update your Kafka Topic
4. Update your Runtime Validation
5. Update your transformations & queries


_Can you see the problem? This process repeats for **every change**._

You also have to test that everything is working together in a safe, isolated dev environment, which is even more painful with so many moving parts.

### What Moose Does
With Moose, your TypeScript and Python code is the single source of truth for **both your data application logic AND your data infrastructure**:

```ts
// Define your model ONCE
import { Key, IngestPipeline } from "@514labs/moose-lib";

interface ExampleModel {
  primaryKey: Key<string>;
  name: string;
  nested: {
    isActive: boolean;
    value: number;
    internalName: string;
  }[];
  createdAt: Date;
}

// And use it EVERYWHERE - ONE line to wire everything up
export const examplePipeline = new IngestPipeline<ExampleModel>("example", {
  ingest: true,    // Creates API endpoint with validation
  stream: true,    // Creates properly structured Redpanda topic
  table: true      // Creates ClickHouse database table
});
```

<CheckmarkBullets
  title="You get end-to-end infrastructure for your data pipeline that is:"
  bullets={[
    "Defined purely in TypeScript or Python code",
    "Completely type safe and validated",
    "Boilerplate free",
    "Able to catch errors at dev time, not at runtime",
    "Running entirely on your laptop and hot reloaded as you save changes in your editor",
  ]}
/>

<CheckmarkBullets
  variant="negative"
  title="No manual synchronization, no context switching between your code editor, your database console, your Kafka client, etc."
  bullets={[
    "“Does my Database table use snake_case or camelCase?”",
    "“Did I add the new field to both the model AND the table?”",
    "“Which database field was nullable again?”",
  ]}
/>

### Local Dev in Seconds

<BulletPointsCard
title="Benefits of Moose's Local Development"
bullets={[
{
title: "One-command startup",
description: "Launch your entire data infrastructure locally with a single command",
},
{
title: "Zero configuration",
description: "All components come pre-configured and fully integrated - no setup required",
},
{
title: "Production parity",
description: "Use the same technologies and logic that will run in production",
},
{
title: "Real-time feedback",
description: "See your changes reflected instantly throughout the stack",
}
]}
/>

Moose comes with a pre-configured and fully integrated data stack that runs entirely on your laptop. Spin it up with one command:
```bash filename="Terminal" copy
moose dev
```
All the infrastructure is automatically spun up:
```txt
⡏ Starting local infrastructure
  Successfully started containers
     Validated clickhousedb-1 docker container
     Validated redpanda-1 docker container
  Successfully validated red panda cluster
     Validated temporal docker container
  Successfully ran local infrastructure
```

<QnABullets
  title="Common workflow scenarios"
  bullets={[
    {
      title: "Need to add or change a model?",
      description: "Moose hot reloads it to your local infrastructure when you save",
    },
    {
      title: "Added a new field?",
      description: "It's instantly available in your API, streams, and database",
    },
    {
      title: "Need to test your pipeline?",
      description: "Send sample data to your local ingest API and see the data flow through",
    }
  ]}
/>

#### Hot Reloading Dev Workflow in Action
Make a change to your model:

```ts filename="HotReload.ts" {11} copy
// Add a field to your model
interface ExampleModel {
  primaryKey: Key<string>;
  name: string;
  nested: {
    isActive: boolean;
    value: number;
    internalName: string;
  }[];
  createdAt: Date;
  status: string; // New field
}
```

Hit save and youll see your changes hot reloaded to your local infrastructure:
```txt {3}
⢹ Processing Infrastructure changes from file watcher
             ~ Topic: orders - Version: 0.0 - Retention Period: 604800s - Partition Count: 1
             ~ Table orders with column changes: [Added(Column { name: "status", data_type: String, required: true, unique: false, primary_key: false, default: None })] and order by changes: OrderByChange { before: [], after: [] }
             ~ Topic to Table Sync Process: orders_0_0 -> orders
             ~ API Endpoint: orders - Version: 0.0 - Path: ingest/orders - Method: POST - Format: Some(Json)
```

<CheckmarkBullets
  title="That's it! No additional steps needed."
  bullets={[
      "Your API now validates this field",
      "Your database schema is updated",
      "Your streams carry the new field",
  ]}
/>

### Modularity

Moose is designed to be modular and configurable. You can pick and choose which components you need and configure them to your liking.

While Moose starts with these sane defaults, we're actively adding support for more backends:

- Additional data warehouses like Snowflake, BigQuery, and Databricks
- Alternative streaming platforms like Kafka and Kinesis
- Different orchestration tools

[Let us know](https://calendly.com/d/cmh5-nrj-9nc/talk-to-engineering) if you'd like to see support for specific platforms in your stack.
