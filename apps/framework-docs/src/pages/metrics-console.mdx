# Monitoring Performance

Moose provides a console to view live metrics from your Moose application. To launch the console, run:

```txt filename="Terminal" copy
moose metrics
```

## HTTP Endpoint Metrics

The following metrics are calculated across all HTTP `/ingest` and `/consumption` endpoints in your Moose application:

| Metric                | Description                                                                         |
| :-------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AVERAGE LATENCY`     | Average time in milliseconds it takes for a request to be processed by the endpoint |
| `TOTAL # OF REQUESTS` | Total number of requests made to the endpoint                                       |
| `REQUESTS PER SECOND` | Average number of requests made per second to the endpoint                          |
| `DATA IN`             | Average number of bytes of data sent to all `/ingest` endpoints per second          |
| `DATA OUT`            | Average number of bytes of data sent to all `/consumption` endpoints per second     |

For each HTTP `/ingest` and `/consumption` endpoint that is configured in your Moose application, we also provide the following metrics:

| Metric                        | Description                                                                         |
| :---------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `LATENCY`                     | Average time in milliseconds it takes for a request to be processed by the endpoint |
| `# OF REQUESTS RECEIVED`      | Total number of requests made to the endpoint                                       |
| `# OF MESSAGES SENT TO KAFKA` | Total number of messages sent to the Kafka topic                                    |

## Kafka To Clickhouse Sync Process Metrics

The following metrics analyze the performance of the process that syncs data from the configured Redpanda topic for a particular Data Model to the Clickhouse database table for that Data Model.

| Metric      | Description                                                                                         |
| :---------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `MSG READ`  | Total number of messages sent from `/ingest` API endpoint to the Kafka topic                        |
| `LAG`       | The number of messages that have been sent to the consumer but not yet received                     |
| `MSG/SEC`   | Average number of messages sent from `/ingest` API endpoint to the Kafka topic per second           |
| `BYTES/SEC` | Average number of bytes of data received by the Clickhouse consumer from the Kafka topic per second |

## Streaming Functions Metrics

These metrics analyze the performance of each Streaming Function configured in your Moose application:

| Metric        | Description                                                                   |
| :------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `MSG IN`      | Total number of messages passed into the streaming function                   |
| `MSG IN/SEC`  | Average number of messages passed into the streaming function per second      |
| `MSG OUT`     | Total number of messages returned by the streaming function                   |
| `MSG OUT/SEC` | Average number of messages returned by the streaming function per second      |
| `BYTES/SEC`   | Average number of bytes of data returned by the streaming function per second |
