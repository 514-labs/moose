# Architectural Rules

## General Principles

- **Keep it Simple (KISS)**: Strive for simplicity in code design.
- **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)**: Eliminate duplication to enhance maintainability.
- **You Ain't Gonna Need It (YAGNI)**: Avoid adding functionality until it's necessary.
- **Readability Matters**: Write code as if the next person to read it is a beginner.

## Code Structure

- Use meaningful and descriptive variable, function, and class names.
- Organize files and directories logically.
- Follow a consistent indentation and formatting style (use linters and formatters).
- Separate concerns: Keep logic modular and avoid monolithic functions.

## Performance Considerations

- Optimize only when necessary—write clear code first.
- Use efficient data structures and algorithms.
- Avoid unnecessary computations and redundant API calls.
- Be mindful of memory usage and garbage collection.

## Security Best Practices

- Never hardcode sensitive data (use environment variables or secrets management tools).
- Sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- Follow the principle of least privilege when managing permissions.
- Keep dependencies updated to mitigate vulnerabilities.

## Error Handling
1. Error types should be located near their unit of fallibility
   - No global `Error` type or `errors.rs` module
   - Each module/component defines its own error types
   - Error types live close to the functions that generate them

2. Use thiserror for error definitions
   - Derive Error trait using #[derive(thiserror::Error)]
   - Use #[error()] attribute for human-readable messages
   - Use #[from] attribute to implement From trait where appropriate
   - Mark error types as #[non_exhaustive]

3. Structure errors in layers
   - Use struct for context (e.g. file paths, line numbers)
   - Use enum for error variants
   - Implement source() to chain underlying errors
   - Example:
     ```rust
     #[derive(Debug, thiserror::Error)]
     #[error("error reading `{path}`")] 
     pub struct FileError {
         pub path: PathBuf,
         #[source]
         pub kind: FileErrorKind
     }
     ```

4. Error matching and handling
   - Make errors inspectable with specific variants
   - Provide enough context for actionable error messages
   - Use meaningful variant names (e.g. ReadFile vs Io)
   - Document error conditions and handling

5. Error stability and privacy
   - Consider making error fields private when needed
   - Don't expose internal error types in public API
   - Use opaque error types for stable interfaces
   - Version error types appropriately

6. Do NOT use anyhow::Result
   - If you see anyhow::Result being used, refactor using this::error

## newtypes
   - Define Newtypes as Tuple Structs: Create newtypes by wrapping existing types in tuple structs to provide distinct types with specific behaviors.
	2.	Implement Constructors with Validation: Provide constructors that enforce invariants, ensuring that only valid data can instantiate the newtype.
	3.	Derive or Implement Essential Traits: Derive standard traits (e.g., Debug, Clone) and manually implement others as needed to integrate seamlessly with Rust’s ecosystem.
	4.	Utilize Conversion Traits: Implement From and TryFrom for ergonomic conversions between newtypes and their underlying types, handling infallible and fallible conversions appropriately.
	5.	Provide Access to Inner Data: Implement traits like AsRef, Deref, or Borrow to grant controlled access to the inner data of the newtype.
	6.	Avoid Circumventing Validations: Prevent bypassing newtype invariants by restricting direct access to the inner type, ensuring all interactions respect the enforced constraints.
	7.	Reduce Boilerplate with Crates: Use crates like derive_more or nutype to minimize repetitive code when implementing common traits and behaviors for newtypes.

## Constants
- Use `const` for all static values in Rust unless interior mutability or runtime evaluation is required.
- Prefer placing constants in a `constants.rs` file.
- The `constants.rs` file should be located at the deepest level in the module tree but at the highest level where all usages of the constants exist.
- Ensure constants are appropriately scoped to avoid unnecessary exposure to unrelated modules.
- Use `pub(crate)` or `pub(super)` instead of `pub` when limiting visibility to the necessary scope.
- Group related constants together for better maintainability and readability.
- Use descriptive names in uppercase with underscores (e.g., `MAX_RETRY_COUNT`).
- When working with enums or complex types, prefer `static` with `lazy_static!` or `once_cell::sync::Lazy` for initialization.
- Avoid redefining constants in multiple places; ensure they are sourced from `constants.rs` where needed.
   
## Documentation
1. All public APIs must be documented
2. Architecture decisions should be documented
3. Side effects should be clearly documented
4. Breaking changes must be documented

## Observability

- Implement logging, metrics, and tracing to gain insights into system behavior.
- Use structured logging for better searchability and debugging.
- Leverage distributed tracing to diagnose performance bottlenecks in microservices.

## Linters
* Always run `cargo clippy` to make sure your changes are right. In Clippy we trust.
* Don't go around the linters by adding exceptions, try to actually use the variables if you find deadcode or delete the code if it is actually not useful.
