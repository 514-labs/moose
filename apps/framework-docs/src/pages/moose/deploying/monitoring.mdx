# Monitoring & Observability

Learn how to monitor your Moose application and gain insights into its performance and health.

## Monitoring Overview

Moose provides built-in monitoring capabilities for all components:

- **Metrics**: Quantitative measurements of your application
- **Logs**: Detailed event records 
- **Traces**: Request flows through your application
- **Alerts**: Notifications when issues occur

## Metrics Console

Moose includes a built-in metrics console that provides real-time visibility into your application:

```bash
# Start the metrics console
moose metrics
```

This opens the Metrics Console UI at `http://localhost:4002` with dashboards for:

- Ingestion rates
- Processing latency
- API response times
- Database query performance
- Error rates
- Resource utilization

## Key Metrics

### Ingestion Metrics

| Metric | Description | Alert Threshold |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| `ingestion.requests.count` | Total ingestion requests | - |
| `ingestion.requests.rate` | Requests per second | >500/s |
| `ingestion.error.rate` | Failed ingestion requests | >1% |
| `ingestion.latency` | Request processing time | >200ms p95 |

### Stream Processing Metrics

| Metric | Description | Alert Threshold |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| `stream.records.count` | Total records processed | - |
| `stream.processing.rate` | Records per second | - |
| `stream.lag` | Processing delay | >5s |
| `stream.errors` | Processing errors | >0 |

### Database Metrics

| Metric | Description | Alert Threshold |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| `db.query.count` | Total queries executed | - |
| `db.query.latency` | Query execution time | >500ms |
| `db.write.rate` | Records written per second | - |
| `db.error.rate` | Database errors | >0 |

## Log Collection

Moose logs are structured for easy analysis:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2023-03-28T14:32:11.342Z",
  "level": "info",
  "service": "ingest-api",
  "message": "Processed event batch",
  "details": {
    "batchId": "batch-123",
    "recordCount": 52,
    "processingTimeMs": 120
  }
}
```

### Log Levels

- **ERROR**: Application errors requiring attention
- **WARN**: Potential issues or degraded performance
- **INFO**: Normal operations and key events
- **DEBUG**: Detailed information for troubleshooting

## Distributed Tracing

Moose supports distributed tracing for request flows:

```typescript
// Trace context is automatically propagated
ingestStream.addTransform(processedStream, async (record, context) => {
  // Trace span is automatically created
  // ...processing logic
  return processedRecord;
});
```

Key trace spans include:
- Ingestion request handling
- Stream processing
- Database operations
- External API calls

## Alerting

Configure alerts in `moose.config.toml`:

```toml
[monitoring.alerts]
# Configure alert thresholds
ingestion_error_rate = { threshold = 0.01, window = "5m" }
processing_lag = { threshold = 10000, window = "1m" }
api_latency_p95 = { threshold = 500, window = "5m" }

# Configure notification channels
[monitoring.notifications]
email = "alerts@example.com"
slack_webhook = "https://hooks.slack.com/services/..."
```

## Integration with External Tools

Moose supports integration with common monitoring tools:

### Prometheus / Grafana

```toml
[monitoring.exporters]
prometheus = { enabled = true, port = 9090 }
```

### ELK Stack

```toml
[monitoring.exporters]
elasticsearch = { 
  enabled = true, 
  endpoint = "https://elasticsearch:9200",
  index = "moose-logs"
}
```

### Datadog

```toml
[monitoring.exporters]
datadog = { 
  enabled = true, 
  api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Monitor All Components**:
   - Ingestion endpoints
   - Stream processing
   - Database queries
   - API responses

2. **Use Structured Logging**:
   - Include request IDs
   - Add contextual information
   - Use appropriate log levels

3. **Set Up Alerts**:
   - Define critical thresholds
   - Configure notification channels
   - Create runbooks for common issues

4. **Performance Baseline**:
   - Establish normal performance metrics
   - Alert on significant deviations
   - Track trends over time

See the [Metrics Console](../metrics-console) documentation for more details on the built-in monitoring capabilities.
