# Product Analytics Template

This template is a great starting point for building a product analytics solution for your web application. It provides a simple example of how to capture page view events from a web app, process them in real-time, and display the processed data on a dashboard, all using Moose.

## Dev Workflow

The following documentation will guide you through the steps to get started with the Product Analytics template. The workflow is divided into four main sections:

1. **Set Up Moose:** Clone the code and start a local server to ingest page view events.
2. **Instrument Your Web App:** Send live page view events to Moose.
3. **Event Processing:** Use Streaming Functions to process raw events.
4. **Visualization:** Display processed data on a NextJS dashboard.

### System Overview

- **Event Capture:** Your web app sends events to Moose via HTTP `POST` requests.
- **Ingestion:** Moose provisions a web server with `/ingest` endpoints to receive and route incoming `POST` requests.
- **Buffering:** Moose buffers events into a designated Redpanda streaming topic.
- **Processing:** Moose runs a background process to transform raw event data into a processed event.
- **Storage:** Moose stores the transformed data in a Clickhouse table.
- **Consumption:** Moose provides the processed data via an API endpoint on the existing web server.
- **Visualization:** The NextJS dashboard frontend web app consumes data from Moose (via the configured APIs) and displays it on a dashboard.
