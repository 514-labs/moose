# Introduction to Blocks

Blocks provide a versatile solution for various database operations and data management tasks. They facilitate:

- **Data Transformation and Views**: Transforming data and creating views or materialized views for pre-computing metrics and performing computationally intensive data analyses.
- **Data Lifecycle Management**: Implementing Time-To-Live (TTL) policies to automatically remove outdated data.
- **Integration Testing**: Setting up and tearing down test environments for easier integration testing of data pipelines.
- **Post-Ingestion Data Manipulation**: Manipulating data after it has been ingested into the database, such as hiding Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or transforming historical data.
- **Access Control Management**: Managing user access levels to different tables to ensure data security and compliance.

## Core Concepts

### File and Folder Conventions

Blocks are stored in the `/blocks` folder within your Moose project. Each block is defined as a file within this directory. The naming convention for these files should be clear and descriptive to indicate the purpose or function of the block.

### Blocks Definition

Inside each block file, you define SQL statements that are executed against the database. These SQL statements can include:

- **Setup SQL**: Commands that initialize or configure the block. The setup SQL is executed on startup.
- **Teardown SQL**: Commands that tear down the block. The teardown SQL is executed on shutdown.

### How Moose Interprets Blocks

Moose interprets and executes the SQL statements defined within the `setup` key of the block on startup.

  In dev mode, Moose continuously watches for changes in the `/blocks` folder
  and re-executes the SQL statements when it detects new blocks or modifications
  to existing ones.
