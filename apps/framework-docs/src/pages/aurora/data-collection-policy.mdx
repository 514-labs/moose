# Aurora Data Collection Policy

Aurora is in research preview. Accordingly, we collect usage data to improve the product.

By default, we collect the most granular data on "ready to use" templates, and we collect less information from the other templates.

You can change the data you share with us by changing the following:

```ts filename="aurora.config.toml"
enable_telemetry = "standard"
```

The available options are:

- `standard` - collects tool usage and success or error status.
- `comprehensive` - collects tool usage, success or error status, and parameters used by the tools.
- `off` - disables telemetry.

Our privacy policy is available [here](https://www.fiveonefour.com/legal/privacy.pdf).
