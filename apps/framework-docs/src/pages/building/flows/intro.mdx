# Introduction

In Moose, setting up data transformation is straightforward: you write a TypeScript function that does the job automatically when new data arrives at the source data model you've chosen.
Your job is simply to tell this function how to change the data from the source model to the destination model you want.

Here's how it works: for every flow, you set the source and destination data models based on how you organize your folders and files in the `/flows` directory of your project.
Moose then knows to watch these spots for new data to process, using your TypeScript code to do the transformation.

Basically, with Moose, you're just setting up a clear path for your data, and the system handles the rest automatically.
