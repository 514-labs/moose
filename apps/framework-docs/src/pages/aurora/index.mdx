## What is Aurora?

Aurora is a set of tools to make your chat, copilot or BI fluent in data engineering. Use the CLI to set up MCPs with the tools you need in the clients you use. Create new data engineering projects with a moose-managed Clickhouse based infrastructure or use these agents with your existing data infrastructure.

## Core features
AUrora offers a comprehensive suite of MCP tools and agents designed to streamline data engineering workflows, enabling faster and more efficient deployment and management.

### CLI based fast deployment
Deploy and configure your system in minutes with a simple, straightforward CLI setup.

- As simple as 3-command setup: install, configure, chat
- Modular agent selection by function
- Native integration: IDE, BI tools, CLI

### Client agnostic
Seamlessly integrate with your preferred tools, allowing you to work in the environments you're already using without disruption.

- Data engineering in your IDE
- Data analytics and analytics engineering in your chat client
- BI in your BI tool of choice

### Infrastructure agnostic, opinionated stack available
Enhance existing infrastructure with AI; or if you are building an OLAP system for high performance analytics, Moose framework allows Aurora to build quickly and efficiently in languages your aplication engineers know—python and typescript.

- Opinionated OLAP deployments with Moose: Optimized ClickHouse development and deployment
- Direct integration with your existing data architecture: DuckDB, Polars, Databricks
- Integration with your enterprise systems: metadata management, CICD, logging and more

### Context-aware data engineering agents
LLMs use Aurora to access all relevant context.

- Full-stack context: code, logs, data, docs
- Self-improving feedback loops
- Embedded metadata for continuity

### Enterprise ready by default
Out-of-the-box production-grade features ensure your environment meets the highest standards for governance, security, and quality.

- Each agent built with context gathering → implementation → testing → documentation workflows
- Governance defaults, easily configurable: SDLC, data quality, reporting, privacy and security default practices
- Learns your policies with minimal context, enforces them automatically
