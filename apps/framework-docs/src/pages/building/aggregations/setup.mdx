# Create Aggregation in CLI

Aggregations are essentially SQL `SELECT` queries defined in a `.ts` file within the `/aggregations` folder of your Moose project.
Moose automatically handles the infrastructure and database setup, ensuring that calculations are updated and executed in real-time as new data becomes available.

Initialize your aggregation in Moose with a CLI command:

```txt filename="Terminal" copy
moose aggregation init <aggregation_name>
```

The command takes an `aggregation_name` which will be used as the filename of the aggregation and the table name of the aggregated data.

# Develop Aggregation Logic

Moose leverages materialized views which are pre-computed queries stored as their own tables. When new data is added to the
source table, the database automatically updates the materialized view with the aggregated data.

You should define the query in the aggregation file. It exports an object with two properties:

- `select` is a valid SQL `SELECT` query that aggregates data
- `orderBy` is a column used to sort the data in the materialized view

The default Moose project comes with an example aggregation, it calculates the number of unique users who complete a sign-in activity each day:

```ts filename="DailyActiveUsers.ts" copy
interface Aggregation {
  select: string;
  orderBy: string;
}

export default {
  select: ` 
    SELECT 
        count(distinct userId) as dailyActiveUsers,
        toStartOfDay(timestamp) as date
    FROM ParsedActivity_0_0
    WHERE activity = 'Login' 
    GROUP BY toStartOfDay(timestamp)
    `,
  orderBy: "date",
} as Aggregation;
```

We recommend iterating on the `SELECT` query in a SQL explorer for a more efficient workflow. Once you’re satisfied with the query
that will aggregate the data, you can easily copy-paste it into the aggregation file. If you’re using VS Code, Moose will automatically
configure a [SQL explorer extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mtxr.sqltools) that will connect to the local database.
You can find these settings in the `.vscode` folder of your Moose project.

# Using Your Aggregation

When you save the aggregation file, Moose automatically creates a new table named after your file and populates it with the results of the `SELECT` statement.
You can then use this table in other queries to build further insights. Check out the Consumption API section of the documentation to learn
how you could create an API to consume the aggregated data.

# Advanced: Aggregations on Aggregations

You can build further aggregations based on existing ones. For example, you might create a time series for average session duration,
average page hits per session, and total page hits over each time interval across all sessions. This allows for dynamic data fetching
and rendering on your dashboard frontend.
