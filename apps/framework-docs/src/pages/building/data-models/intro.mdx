## Data Models Introduction

Data Models are foundational to your MooseJS application. Using Data Models, you define the schemas of the data you need to support in your application. Based on these simple schema definitions, MooseJS will configure end-to-end data infrastructure for you:

- A typed data capture SDK to instrument your application
- A high-performance ingestion server to receive data from your application
- A buffer to store data as it's ingested from the ingestion server
- An ingestion table and an analytics view to store and query your data
