## Setting up Aurora MCP with Aurora CLI

<Steps>

### Installing Aurora and Moose CLIs

<Callout type="info" title="Prerequisites">
- **OS**: macOS or Linux (WSL supported for Windows)
- **Node**: [version 20+](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (LTS recommended)
- **Client**: [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) or [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) or [Windsurf](https://windsurf.ai/download). For this particular use-case, we recommend Claude Desktop.
- **Anthropic API key**: [Get your API key from Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/initial-setup). This is required for using Aurora's generative MCP tools.
- **Docker Desktop/Engine**: [24.0.0+](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/). This is required for using Aurora with a local Moose project.
</Callout>

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
bash -i <(curl -fsSL https://fiveonefour.com/install.sh) aurora,moose
```

### Add your Anthropic API key when prompted

<Callout type="info" title="Prerequisites">
- **Anthropic API key**: [Get your API key from Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/initial-setup)
</Callout>


If you don't add the API key on install, you will still be able to use the [read-only MCP tools](/aurora/reference/tool-reference#read-tools). If you want to later add your API key, you can do so with 

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
aurora config keys <"your-api-key">
```

### Allow Aurora Keychain Access 
Aurora uses the macOS Keychain to store your API keys. You will be prompted to allow access to the Keychain when installing the CLI. To prevent it from asking several times, select "Always Allow" when prompted.

### Start a new project with Aurora MCP

Want to start by [chatting with your data that's already in ClickHouse](../aurora/quickstart/clickhouse-chat)?
```bash filename="Terminal" copy
aurora connect clickhouse --connection-string "https://explorer:@play.clickhouse.com:443/?database=default" --mcp claude-desktop
```

Want to start by [creating a Moose project from data that's already in ClickHouse](../aurora/quickstart/clickhouse-proj)?

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
aurora init my_project_name --from-remote 'https://explorer:@play.clickhouse.com:443/?database=default' --language python --mcp windsurf-global
```

Want to get started by [creating a new Moose project from a template](../aurora/quickstart/from-template)?

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
aurora init my_project_name ADS-B --mcp cursor-project
```

For a full list of templates, run `moose template`.

Want to get started by creating a new Moose project from scratch?

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
aurora init my_project_name typescript-empty --mcp cursor-project
```

Start a new typescript project with `typescript-empty` or a python project with `python-empty`.

Want to add Aurora MCP to your existing Moose project? Navigate to your Moose project directory and run:

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
aurora setup --mcp cursor-project
```

</Steps>

## Configuring Aurora MCP with MCP.JSON

<Callout type="info" title="Prerequisites">
- **OS**: macOS or Linux (WSL supported for Windows)
- **Node**: [version 20+](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (LTS recommended)
- **Client**: [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) or [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) or [Windsurf](https://windsurf.ai/download). For this particular use-case, we recommend Claude Desktop.
- **Anthropic API key**: [Get your API key from Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/initial-setup). This is required for using Aurora's generative MCP tools.
- **Docker Desktop/Engine**: [24.0.0+](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/). This is required for using Aurora with a local Moose project.
</Callout>

<Steps>

### Installing Moose CLI

<Callout type="warning" title="Moose CLI requirement">
Note, even if you don't use the Aurora CLI to configure your Aurora MCP, the Moose CLI is still required if you want to use Moose toolsets (e.g. everything but `remote-clickhouse` and experimental external tools)
</Callout>

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
bash -i <(curl -fsSL https://fiveonefour.com/install.sh) moose
```

### Where is your MCP.JSON file?

Your MCP.JSON file is located in a diffent location depending on your client of choice. The below is a list of default locations for the MCP.JSON file for our supported clients.

* [Claude Desktop](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user): `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (note, you can create this by going to `claude > settings > Developer > Edit Config`)
* [Cursor (global MCP)](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol#configuration-locations): `~/.cursor/settings/mcp.json`
* [Cursor (project MCP)](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol#configuration-locations): `/path/to/your/project/.cursor/mcp.json`
* [Windsurf](https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/cascade/mcp#configuring-mcp-tools): `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`

For other clients, look to their documentation for where their MCP.JSON file is located.

### Adding Aurora MCP to your MCP.JSON file

Your MCP.JSON contains an mcpServers object, which is an array of MCP servers. To add Aurora MCP to your MCP.JSON file, you need to add the following to the mcpServers array:

```json filename="MCP.JSON" copy
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aurora": {
      "args": [
        "@514labs/aurora-mcp@latest",
        "--moose-read-tools",
        "--moose-write-tools"
        ...other tool-sets,
        "path/to/your/moose/project"
      ],
      "command": "npx",
      "env": {
        "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": "<your-anthropic-api-key>",
        "MOOSE_PATH": "path/to/your/moose/installation",
        "NODE_PATH": "path/to/your/node/installation",
        "PYTHON_PATH": "path/to/your/python/installation"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Arguments / Environment Variables**

<ArgTable
  args={[
    {
      name: "npx path",
      required: true,
      description: "NPX path to aurora; should be `@514labs/aurora-mcp@latest`"
    },
    {
      name: "tool flags",
      required: true,
      description: "Selected tool flags; see [Tool Reference](/aurora/reference/tool-reference) for available flags (e.g. `--read-only`, `--moose-write-tools`, `--remote-clickhouse`)"
    },
    {
      name: "Moose Path",
      required: false,
      description: "Path to your moose project. Not required if you are only using the `remote-clickhouse` tool."
    },
    {
      name: "Anthropic API Key",
      required: false,
      description: "Your Anthropic API key. If you don't have an Anthropic API key, see the Anthropic initial setup guide: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/initial-setup. This is required for using Aurora's generative MCP tools."
    },
    {
        name: "Moose Path",
        required: false,
        description: "Path to your moose installation. Not required if you are only using the `remote-clickhouse` tool."
    },
    {
      name: "Node Path",
      required: false,
      description: "Path to your node installation. Not required if you are only using the `remote-clickhouse` tool. Not required if you are using other tools within Python projects."
    },
    {
      name: "Python Path",
      required: false,
      description: "Path to your python installation. Not required if you are only using the `remote-clickhouse` tool. Not required if you are using other tools within Python projects."
    }
  ]}
/>

### Adding tool sets to your MCP.JSON file

<Callout type="warning" title="Recommended tools">
In general, we recommend using read-only tool-sets (`moose-read-tools` and `remote-clickhouse`) with chat type clients (like Claude Desktop)
</Callout>

For information about toolsets, see [tools reference](../aurora/reference/tool-reference).

**[Read only Moose tools](../aurora/reference/tool-reference#moose-read-tools)**

```json 
"args": [
    ...
    "--moose-read-tools",
]
--
```

**[Moose write tools](../aurora/reference/tool-reference#moose-write-tools)** 

```json 
"args": [
    ...
    "--moose-read-tools",
    "--moose-write-tools",
]
```

**[Remote Clickhouse read tools](../aurora/reference/tool-reference#remote-clickhouse)**

```json
"args": [
  ...
  "--remote-clickhouse", 
  ...
]
"env": {
  ...
  "BOREAL_CLICKHOUSE_HOST": "...",
  "BOREAL_CLICKHOUSE_PORT": "...",
  "BOREAL_CLICKHOUSE_USER": "...",
  "BOREAL_CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD": "...",
  "BOREAL_CLICKHOUSE_DATABASE": "...",
}
```

**Other experimental tools**

[Contact us!](mailto:aurora@fiveonefour.com)
</Steps>

## Client Reference

In general, we recommend:
1. only use "read" tool-sets (e.g. `moose-read-tools`, `remote-clickhouse`) with chat type clients (e.g. Claude Desktop, Librechat, etc.)
2. where possible, use project level MCP configuration

### Claude Desktop

<Steps>

#### Install 
[Install the Claude Desktop application here](https://claude.ai/download). Note, the Pro version appears to work much more stably with MCPs.

#### Configure Aurora MCP

From an existing Moose project: 
```
aurora setup --mcp claude-desktop
```

From an existing Clickhouse project (chat only): 
```
aurora connect clickhouse --connection-string "https://explorer:@play.clickhouse.com:443/?database=default" --mcp claude-desktop
```

Create a new project with Claude Desktop MCP preconfigured: 
```
aurora init <project-name> <template-name> --mcp claude-desktop
```

Using MCP.JSON

```json filename="~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json" copy
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aurora": {
      "args": [
        "@514labs/aurora-mcp@latest",
        "--moose-read-tools",
        "path/to/your/moose/project"
      ],
      "command": "npx",
      "env": {
        "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": "<your-anthropic-api-key>",
        "MOOSE_PATH": "path/to/your/moose/installation",
        "NODE_PATH": "path/to/your/node/installation",
        "PYTHON_PATH": "path/to/your/python/installation"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Adding other toolsets

**Recommended toolsets**

* [Moose Read Tools](../aurora/reference/tool-reference#moose-read-tools): gives you chat access to your Moose project and the data within it (enabled by default)
* [Remote ClickHouse Tools](../aurora/reference/tool-reference#remote-clickhouse) (read only): gives you chat access to your remote ClickHouse data

#### Using the MCP

1. Open the Claude Desktop application (note, you often have to reload the application after adding a new MCP)
2. If you are using Moose tools, you will need to run your moose dev server

</Steps>

#### Warnings / Peculiarities

* You shouldn't use "write"/genetaive tools with Claude Desktop.
* Every time you add an MCP or change its configuration, you will need to reload the application.
* If you want to change the Moose Project that the Aurora MCP is referring to, manually edit the MCP.JSON file or run `aurora config focus` and select a new project.

#### Common issues / troubleshooting

* The MCP is running, but you aren't able to get your data? Look at the tool call response, it will tell you if your Moose dev server is running. If it is not, run `moose dev` in your Moose project directory.
* The MCP is not running. Check your configuration and then restart the application.

### Cursor

<Steps>

#### Install 
[Install Cursor here](https://www.cursor.com/).

#### Configure Aurora MCP

From an existing Moose project: 
```
aurora setup --mcp cursor-project
```

or (if you want to use the MCP globally, which we do not recommend)

```
aurora setup --mcp cursor-global
```

From an existing Clickhouse project (chat only): 
```
aurora connect clickhouse --connection-string "https://explorer:@play.clickhouse.com:443/?database=default" --mcp cursor-project
```

Create a new project with Claude Desktop MCP preconfigured: 
```
aurora init <project-name> <template-name> --mcp cursor-project
```

Using MCP.JSON

```json filename="~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json" copy
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aurora": {
      "args": [
        "@514labs/aurora-mcp@latest",
        "--moose-read-tools",
        "path/to/your/moose/project"
      ],
      "command": "npx",
      "env": {
        "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": "<your-anthropic-api-key>",
        "MOOSE_PATH": "path/to/your/moose/installation",
        "NODE_PATH": "path/to/your/node/installation",
        "PYTHON_PATH": "path/to/your/python/installation"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Adding other toolsets

All toolsets are available to Cursor MCPs. See [tools reference](../aurora/reference/tool-reference) for more information.

#### Using the MCP

1. Open Cursor
2. You will see a popup saying that an MCP is detected, and can be enabled. Our experience is that this is not always reliable, and the MCP is more stably launched if you go to `cursor > settings > cursor settings > tools and integrations` and enable the MCP there.
3. If you are using Moose tools, you will need to run your moose dev server with `moose dev`.

</Steps>

#### Warnings / Peculiarities

* Every time you add an MCP or change its configuration, you will need to reload the MCP. You can do this by going to `cursor > settings > cursor settings > tools and integrations` and toggling the MCP off and on. If this doesn't work, you can also restart the Cursor application.
* If you have configured the MCP globally, and want to change the Moose Project that the Aurora MCP is referring to, manually edit the MCP.JSON file or run `aurora config focus` and select a new project.

#### Common issues / troubleshooting

* The MCP is running, but you aren't able to get your data? Look at the tool call response, it will tell you if your Moose dev server is running. If it is not, run `moose dev` in your Moose project directory.
* The MCP is not running. Check your configuration and then restart the application.


### Windsurf

<Steps>

#### Install 
[Install Windsurf here](https://windsurf.com/).

#### Configure Aurora MCP

From an existing Moose project: 
```
aurora setup --mcp windsurf-global
```

From an existing Clickhouse project (chat only): 
```
aurora connect clickhouse --connection-string "https://explorer:@play.clickhouse.com:443/?database=default" --mcp windsurf-global
```

Create a new project with Claude Desktop MCP preconfigured: 
```
aurora init <project-name> <template-name> --mcp windsurf-global
```

Using MCP.JSON

```json filename="/path/to/your/project/.cursor/mcp.json" copy
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aurora": {
      "args": [
        "@514labs/aurora-mcp@latest",
        "--moose-read-tools",
        "path/to/your/moose/project"
      ],
      "command": "npx",
      "env": {
        "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": "<your-anthropic-api-key>",
        "MOOSE_PATH": "path/to/your/moose/installation",
        "NODE_PATH": "path/to/your/node/installation",
        "PYTHON_PATH": "path/to/your/python/installation"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Adding other toolsets

All toolsets are available to Cursor MCPs. See [tools reference](../aurora/reference/tool-reference) for more information.

#### Using the MCP

1. Open Windsurf
2. Run the MCP by going to `windsurf > settings > windsurf settings > cascade > Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers` and enable the MCP there.
3. If you are using Moose tools, you will need to run your moose dev server with `moose dev`.

</Steps>

#### Warnings / Peculiarities

* Every time you add an MCP or change its configuration, you will need to reload the MCP. You can do this by going to `windsurg > settings > windsurf settings > cascade > Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers` and toggling the MCP off and on or refreshing the server. If this doesn't work, you can also restart the Windsurf application.
* If you have configured the MCP globally, and want to change the Moose Project that the Aurora MCP is referring to, manually edit the MCP.JSON file or run `aurora config focus` and select a new project.

#### Common issues / troubleshooting

* The MCP is running, but you aren't able to get your data? Look at the tool call response, it will tell you if your Moose dev server is running. If it is not, run `moose dev` in your Moose project directory.
* The MCP is not running. Check your configuration and then restart the application.

### Other clients

We are working on adding MCP support for other clients. If you are interested in using other clients, please [contact us](mailto:aurora@fiveonefour.com).

Feel free to [use the MCP.JSON file within your client of choice](../aurora/reference/mcp-json).
