# Aggregate Programming Languages with Blocks

In the `ProcessedStarEvent` table, the `languages` column contains nested arrays of programming languages used by each starrer across all their repositories. This structure makes it difficult to analyze which programming languages are most popular among all the starrers. To address this, you can use Moose **Blocks** to create a view that unpacks the `languages` array, allowing for easier analysis of this data.

<Callout type="info" title="What are Blocks?">
  The [Blocks primitive](/db-processing) lets you execute SQL statements against
  your database to set up processes or objects in your database. This includes
  creating views or materialized views to aggregate, join, or group data from
  various rows and tables.
</Callout>

## Initialize a New Block: `userLanguageTable`

<Steps>
### Use the Moose CLI `blocks init` Helper
In your terminal, run:
```bash filename="Terminal" copy
npx moose-cli blocks init userLanguageTable
```

This command will generate a new file named `userLanguageTable.ts` and place it inside the `/blocks` folder of your application:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="app" open>
    <FileTree.Folder name="blocks" open>
      <FileTree.File name="userLanguageTable.ts" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

### Open and Inspect the File

You should see the following boilerplate:

```ts filename="app/blocks/userLanguageTable.ts" copy
import { Blocks } from "@514labs/moose-lib";

export default {
  setup: [
    // Array of SQL statements for setting up database resources
  ],
  teardown: [
    // Array of SQL statements for tearing down resources
  ],
} as Blocks;
```

<Callout type="info" title="Blocks Structure">
  - The `Blocks` type is imported from the `@514labs/moose-lib` library. This
  ensures type safety for the `setup` and `teardown` properties. - The `default
  export` is an object that conforms to the `Blocks` type. - **`setup`**: - An
  array of SQL strings executed to set up the necessary database objects or
  views. - These statements are run by Moose on your database automatically
  whenever you start your dev server. The results of these statements create and
  persist processes in your database. - **`teardown`**: - An array of SQL
  statements used to clean up or delete the database objects created during the
  setup. - These statements are automatically executed by Moose when you stop
  your dev server.
</Callout>

### Define SQL Statements to Create and Drop `userLanguages` View

Create a view named `userLanguages` to simplify the structure of the programming languages data, so that it iseasier to analyze which languages are most popular among the users who starred your repository. Each row in the view will represent a unique combination of a user and a programming language they use, along with the amount of code they've written in that language.

Paste in the following SQL statements into the `setup` and `teardown` arrays inside the `Blocks` object, like so:

```ts filename="app/blocks/userLanguageTable.ts" copy
import { Blocks } from "@514labs/moose-lib";

export default {
  // Sequences of SQL you can apply to a database
  setup: [
    `
   CREATE VIEW userLanguages AS
    SELECT DISTINCT 
        username AS user, 
        arrayFirst(x->x IS NOT NULL, language_object.language) AS language, 
        arrayFirst(x->x IS NOT NULL, language_object.bytes) AS bytes 
    FROM 
        local.ProcessedStarEvent_0_0
    ARRAY JOIN 
    languages AS language_object
   `,
  ],
  // Delete and clean up the objects from the database
  teardown: [`DROP VIEW userLanguages`],
} as Blocks;
```

In this example:

- The `setup` array contains a single SQL statement that creates a view named `userLanguages`
- The `teardown` array contains a single SQL statement that drops the `userLanguages` view

<Callout type="info" title="Why Create a View?">
  This view simplifies the structure of the programming languages data, so that
  it's easier to analyze which languages are most popular among the users who
  starred your repository. Each row in the view represents a unique combination
  of a user and a programming language they use, along with the amount of code
  they've written in that language.
</Callout>

<ToggleBlock openText="Expand for Detailed Breakdown" closeText="Collapse Breakdown">
This view transforms the data from the `ProcessedStarEvent` table, by:
- Selecting distinct combinations of the Github usernames, programming languages, and number of bytes written in that language
- Unpacking the nested `languages` array from the source table

The resulting view will have 3 columns:

- `user`: The username of the person who starred the repository
- `language`: A programming language used by the user
- `bytes`: The number of bytes of code written in that language by the user
  </ToggleBlock>

### Save the File

Saving your changes to the `userLanguageTable.ts` file will update the infrastructure controlled by Moose-- in this case, the `userLanguages` view will be instantiated.

### Verify the `userLanguages` View was Created

Open your database explorer and inspect the list of views in your Clickhouse database. You should now see a view called `userLanguage` with columns `user`, `language`, and `bytes`.

Take a look at the data inside the view!

</Steps>

<Callout type="success">
  Now you can easily understand the expertise and coding preferences of users
  who starred your repository! To recap:
  <br /> <br />
  <ul>
    - You initialized a new [Block](/db-processing) using the Moose CLI helper
    function - Inside the Block, you set up a view that unpacks the nested
    `languages` array in the `ProcessedStarEvent` table - This view offers a
    detailed breakdown of the programming languages used by each user who
    starred your repository
  </ul>
  <br />
  Your data is now processed, analyzed, and ready for building APIs that
  integrate insights from your GitHub data into other applications.
