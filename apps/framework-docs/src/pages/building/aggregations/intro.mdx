# Introduction

Aggregations allow you to derive new, meaningful datasets from existing database tables. By summarizing, combining, filtering, and grouping data across your table rows and columns, aggregations optimize query performance and provide real-time insights. Defined as SQL `SELECT` queries, they operate directly on your database. These queries are executed whenever new data is appended to your tables, and the results are stored as dedicated tables. This ensures your aggregation data is always ready for immediate use in your Moose application or other external applications consuming data from Moose.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of Aggregations is to facilitate pre-computing results for your most common queries and data table transformations. They let you ensure that your transformations are continuously updated and readily available for high-performance querying and analysis. Aggregations are ideal for scenarios where you need to summarize, join, filter, and group data across multiple tables, and save those results for future use without having to recompute them every time you need them.

## How Aggregations Work

As a developer, you write a SQL `SELECT` query to perform transformations on your existing database tables. This query can:

- Summarize column data using aggregation functions like `SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, etc.
- Group data by one or more columns to create summary statistics.
- Compute new columns derived from other columns in the table.
- Combine or filter data from multiple tables using `JOIN` and `WHERE` clauses.

The SQL `SELECT` query is defined as a string and exported from a TypeScript file. When saved inside the `/aggregations` folder of your Moose project, Moose creates a materialized view in your database using the provided query. Moose currently supports Clickhouse for the database layer, which automatically updates the result set of your aggregation query in real-time as new data is added to your source table(s).
