# Data Stack Architecture

Moose automates your data infrastructure with the following components:

- **Ingestion Layer**: Captures data via API endpoints and SDKs.
- **Streaming Layer**: Manages peak loads with streaming buffers and processes to transform data between data model streams.
- **Database Layer**: Uses OLAP databases for storing and querying data.
- **Orchestration Layer**: Sets up workflows for data ingestion, transformation, storage, and querying.
- **Database Transformation Layer**: Defines pipelines with views and materialized views for pre-computed datasets.
- **Consumption Layer**: Builds custom analytics APIs with type-safe endpoints for user-facing analytics and dashboards.

## Packaging Architecture

Moose applications can be packaged in two ways:

1. **Dev**: Local server with Redpanda for streaming, Clickhouse for storage, Node/Python for processing, and Temporal for orchestration. Run with `moose dev`.
2. **Prod**: Scalable deployment on-prem, in the cloud, or on [Boreal.cloud](https://boreal.cloud). Package with `moose build --docker`.

The "Dev" setup is for local development, updating in real-time with code changes. It includes all necessary infrastructure for easy setup.

The "Prod" setup supports large-scale workloads, packaged for easy deployment and scaling. It integrates with existing data clusters, supporting Redpanda for streaming and Clickhouse for storage.

## Modularizing Infrastructure

Moose allows you to customize your infrastructure. Exclude components like Redpanda if not needed, ensuring your application is optimized for your specific use case.
