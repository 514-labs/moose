# Runtime
<LanguageSwitcher />

## Overview

The Runtime capability provides standalone deployment, monitoring, and management for MooseStack applications. You can use this capability independently to deploy and manage any MooseStack component without requiring all capabilities to be present.

## Standalone Usage

The Runtime capability is designed to work independently. You can use it without requiring all MooseStack components:

<BulletPointsCard
  title="Independent Operations"
  bullets={[
    {
      title: "Component-level deployment",
      description: "Deploy individual capabilities (APIs, databases, streams) independently"
    },
    {
      title: "Isolated monitoring",
      description: "Monitor each capability separately with its own metrics and alerts"
    },
    {
      title: "Flexible scaling",
      description: "Scale each capability based on its specific workload requirements"
    },
    {
      title: "Gradual adoption",
      description: "Start with runtime for one capability, add others over time"
    }
  ]}
/>

## Integration with Other Capabilities

The Runtime capability provides the foundation for operating all other MooseStack capabilities:

- **OLAP Database**: Deploy and monitor database infrastructure
- **APIs**: Deploy API services with load balancing and monitoring
- **Streaming**: Deploy stream processing infrastructure with scaling
- **Workflows**: Deploy workflow engines with task monitoring
- **Planning**: Use runtime metrics to inform architecture decisions

**Getting Started**: Begin with [Deployment](/moosestack/runtime/deploy) to understand how to deploy your first MooseStack capability.
