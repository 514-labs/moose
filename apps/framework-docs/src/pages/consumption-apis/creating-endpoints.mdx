# Initialize Your API Endpoint

## via the CLI

To create a new Consumption API endpoint, leverage the `moose-cli consumption init` command. This will generate a `.ts` or `.py` file in the `/apis` directory with the following structure:

```ts
import { ConsumptionUtil } from "@514labs-moose-lib";
// This file is where you can define your API templates for consuming your data
// All query_params are passed in as strings, and are used within the sql tag to parameterize your queries
export interface QueryParams {}

export default async function handle(
  {}: QueryParams,
  { client, sql }: ConsumptionUtil,
) {
  return client.query(sql``);
}
```

For detailed information about the moose block init command, you can run the following in your terminal:

```bash copy
npx moose-cli consumption init --help
```

## Manually

You can alternatively manually create a new `.ts` or `.py` file inside the `/apis` folder of your project.
