# Observability


This page consolidates Moose observability for both local development and production environments.

## Local Development

### Metrics Console

Moose provides a console to view live metrics from your Moose application. To launch the console, run:

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
moose metrics
```

<Callout type="info" title="Use Up/Down Arrows to Navigate" icon={ArrowUpDownIcon} compact>
Use the arrow keys to move up and down rows in the endpoint table and press Enter to view more details about that endpoint.

| `BYTES/SEC` | Average number of bytes of data received by the ClickHouse consumer from the Kafka topic per second |

#### Streaming Transformation Metrics
For each streaming transformation:

| Metric        | Description                                                                   |
| :------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `MSG OUT`     | Total number of messages returned by the streaming function                   |
| `MSG OUT/SEC` | Average number of messages returned by the streaming function per second      |
| `BYTES/SEC`   | Average number of bytes of data returned by the streaming function per second |

## Production

### Health Monitoring

Moose applications expose a health check endpoint at `/health` that returns a 200 OK response when the application is operational. This endpoint is used by container orchestration systems like Kubernetes to determine the health of your application.

In production environments, we recommend configuring three types of probes:

1. Startup Probe: Gives Moose time to initialize before receiving traffic
2. Readiness Probe: Determines when the application is ready to receive traffic
3. Liveness Probe: Detects when the application is in a deadlocked state and needs to be restarted

</Callout>

### Prometheus Metrics

Moose applications expose metrics in Prometheus format at the `/metrics` endpoint. These metrics include:

- HTTP request latency histograms for each endpoint
- Request counts and error rates
- System metrics for the Moose process

Example metrics output:

```
# HELP latency Latency of HTTP requests.
# TYPE latency histogram
latency_sum{method="POST",path="ingest/UserActivity"} 0.025
latency_count{method="POST",path="ingest/UserActivity"} 2
latency_bucket{le="0.001",method="POST",path="ingest/UserActivity"} 0
latency_bucket{le="0.01",method="POST",path="ingest/UserActivity"} 0
latency_bucket{le="0.02",method="POST",path="ingest/UserActivity"} 1
latency_bucket{le="0.05",method="POST",path="ingest/UserActivity"} 1
latency_bucket{le="0.1",method="POST",path="ingest/UserActivity"} 1
latency_bucket{le="0.25",method="POST",path="ingest/UserActivity"} 1
latency_bucket{le="0.5",method="POST",path="ingest/UserActivity"} 1
latency_bucket{le="1.0",method="POST",path="ingest/UserActivity"} 1
latency_bucket{le="5.0",method="POST",path="ingest/UserActivity"} 1
latency_bucket{le="10.0",method="POST",path="ingest/UserActivity"} 1
latency_bucket{le="30.0",method="POST",path="ingest/UserActivity"} 1
latency_bucket{le="60.0",method="POST",path="ingest/UserActivity"} 1
latency_bucket{le="120.0",method="POST",path="ingest/UserActivity"} 1
latency_bucket{le="240.0",method="POST",path="ingest/UserActivity"} 1
latency_bucket{le="+Inf",method="POST",path="ingest/UserActivity"} 1
```

You can scrape these metrics using a Prometheus server or any compatible monitoring system.

### OpenTelemetry Integration

In production deployments, Moose can export telemetry data using OpenTelemetry. Enable via environment variables:

```
MOOSE_TELEMETRY__ENABLED=true
MOOSE_TELEMETRY__EXPORT_METRICS=true
```

When running in Kubernetes with an OpenTelemetry operator, you can configure automatic sidecar injection by adding annotations to your deployment:

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    "sidecar.opentelemetry.io/inject": "true"
```

### Logging

Configure structured logging via environment variables:

```
MOOSE_LOGGER__LEVEL=Info
MOOSE_LOGGER__STDOUT=true
MOOSE_LOGGER__FORMAT=Json
```

The JSON format is ideal for log aggregation systems (ELK Stack, Graylog, Loki, or cloud logging solutions).

### Production Monitoring Stack

Recommended components:

1. Metrics Collection: Prometheus or cloud-native monitoring services
2. Log Aggregation: ELK Stack, Loki, or cloud logging solutions
3. Distributed Tracing: Jaeger or other OpenTelemetry-compatible backends
4. Alerting: Alertmanager or cloud provider alerting

### Error Tracking

Integrate with systems like Sentry via environment variables:

```
SENTRY_DSN=https://your-sentry-dsn
RUST_BACKTRACE=1
```
