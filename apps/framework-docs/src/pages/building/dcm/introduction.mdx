## Context: why do we need Data Change Management (DCM)?

Data, like software, has a life of its own. As the environment evolves, so does the
data it produces. On the consuming end, data is also a moving target. Business needs
evolve, and data and metrics that need to be tracked change too.

As such, our data systems need built-in processes to evolve data.
In SQL databases, we have `ALTER TABLE` statements. We also have ORMs and database
migration tools. Those are well suited for Transactional workloads and database
schema evolutions. However, they are not appropriate for Data Analytics and OLAP
storage. Why? because the requirements are very different between the analytics and
the transactional, especially when it comes to size.

In transactional databases, we necessarily emphasize the consistency of the data
and the atomicity of the transactions—schema change operations in SQL are atomic.
When the data gets big, managing the schemas and their evolutions becomes challenging,
and complex systems have been built to handle that complexity.

For analytical databases, we have stayed at the point where tables are evolved
manually or through a similar schema change tool from the transactional side.
Whilst the tools are similar to those used for transaction data migrations,
the constraints are very different. More often than not, the data is event-based
and immutable, meaning it can get duplicated without the overhead otherwise needed to
keep versions in sync. On top of that, in analytical databases, the producer and consumer
of the data are often decoupled, whereas in a transactional system, those are often the same.
For example, in a transactional system, you might have one service, that has its database.
No other service touches that database. All external requests go through the API. As such,
evolving the database is self-contained to evolving the service.

On the analytics side, usually, the data is consumed by business dashboarding tools,
and the dashboard evolves on a different schedule than the side producing the data.
Most of the time, they are owned by different teams.

On the transactional side, we constrained the problem. On the analytics side,
the data is sandwiched between 2 sides that evolve at different speeds.
Today's tools don't allow us to solve that problem quickly.

Data Change Management in Moose is an attempt to solve for that.
