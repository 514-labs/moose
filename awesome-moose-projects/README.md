In this directory we have some of the projects we've built with Moose. From weekend hackathons to production grade 100TB/day observability-as-a-service products, so long as data is at the core, we've got you covered. 

Feel free to browse, comment and eventually contribute back to this repo. If you've got any ideas please reach out to any of us on [slack](https://join.slack.com/t/moose-community/shared_invite/zt-2fjh5n3wz-cnOmM9Xe9DYAgQrNu8xKxg), and we'd be happy to roll up our sleeves and support you at any phase while you build something awesome with Moose.
