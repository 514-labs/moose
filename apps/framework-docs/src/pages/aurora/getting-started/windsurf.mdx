## Windsurf

<Steps>

### Install Windsurf
[Install Windsurf here](https://windsurf.com/).

### Install Moose and Aurora

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
bash -i <(curl -fsSL https://fiveonefour.com/install.sh) aurora,moose
```

### Configure Aurora MCP

<Tabs items={['Aurora CLI', 'MCP.json']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    Create a new project with Windsurf MCP preconfigured: 

    ```bash filename="Terminal" copy
    aurora init <project-name> <template-name> --mcp windsurf-global
    ```

    For other options, see [Aurora CLI docs](/aurora/getting-started/aurora-cli).
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```json filename="~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json" copy
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "aurora": {
          "args": [
            "@514labs/aurora-mcp@latest",
            "--moose-read-tools",
            "path/to/your/moose/project"
          ],
          "command": "npx",
          "env": {
            "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": "<your-anthropic-api-key>",
            "MOOSE_PATH": "path/to/your/moose/installation",
            "NODE_PATH": "path/to/your/node/installation",
            "PYTHON_PATH": "path/to/your/python/installation"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

### Adding other toolsets

For more information on available toolsets, see [Aurora MCP toolsets](/aurora/reference/tool-reference). All toolsets are available for Windsurf.

### Using the MCP

1. Open Windsurf
2. Run the MCP by going to `windsurf > settings > windsurf settings > cascade > Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers` and enable the MCP there.
3. If you are using Moose tools, you will need to run your moose dev server with `moose dev`.

</Steps>

### Warnings / Peculiarities

* Every time you add an MCP or change its configuration, you will need to reload the MCP. You can do this by going to `windsurf > settings > windsurf settings > cascade > Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers` and toggling the MCP off and on or refreshing the server. If this doesn't work, you can also restart the Windsurf application.
* If you have configured the MCP globally, and want to change the Moose Project that the Aurora MCP is referring to, manually edit the MCP.JSON file or run `aurora config focus` and select a new project.

### Common issues / troubleshooting

* The MCP is running, but you aren't able to get your data? Look at the tool call response, it will tell you if your Moose dev server is running. If it is not, run `moose dev` in your Moose project directory.
* The MCP is not running. Check your configuration and then restart the application.
