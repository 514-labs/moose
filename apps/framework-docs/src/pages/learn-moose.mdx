# Learn Moose

By the end of this tutorial you will have a solid grasp of the Moose framework and you will have built an end-to-end data and analytics service which gives you real-time insights into the users who star your Github repository. Here’s a high level diagram of what you will build:

In Typescript (or Python!) you declare your application logic in four primitives — Data Models, Function, Blocks and Consumption APIs — and Moose automatically creates the assets in your underlying infrastructure.

## What You'll Build

In this tutorial, you will:

1. Create a new Moose project from scratch and define your first Moose primitive (a **Data Model**) to start **ingesting** sample data within minutes.
2. Configure GitHub to send live webhook notifications to your Moose application whenever someone stars your repository.
3. Implement a Moose **Streaming Function** to filter and enrich the raw webhook event data as it’s ingested.
4. Use Moose **Blocks** to create a view of the processed event data for further analysis.
5. Build **Consumption APIs to** surface insights about the programming languages the starrers use in their repositories.
6. Access and analyze these insights via an API Client.
