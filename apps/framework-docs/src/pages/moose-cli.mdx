# Installation

MooseJS comes with a handy CLI for managing your MooseJS application. Navigate to your project's directory to run commands. There are a few ways to run the CLI:

<Steps>
### NPX
The simplest method to run the CLI is via NPX. No extra installation is necessary for this method.
```txt filename="Terminal" copy
npx @514labs/moose-cli <command>
```

### Dependency install

Alternatively, the Moose CLI comes packaged with your Moose application. You can install the dependency locally and then run the Moose CLI within your project with:

```txt filename="Terminal" copy
npm install
npm run <command>
```

### Global install

Finally, you can install the Moose CLI globally using NPM. This will get you a cleaner command interface, and better performance on the CLI. You can then run the Moose CLI anywhere.

```txt filename="Terminal" copy
npm install -g @514labs/moose-cli
moose <command>
```

</Steps>

### Init

Instead of using `create-moose-app`, you can initialize your project manually with the CLI, if you'd like more flexibility and control. Either option will initialize a new MooseJS project for you, with all the necessary directories including temporary ones for data storage.

```txt filename="Terminal" copy
moose init <name> --language <language> --location <location>
```

- `<name>`: Name of your app or service.
- `--language <language>`: Language of your app or service. We currently only support `Typescript`.
- `--location <location>`: Location of your app or service. The default is the current directory (`.`).

### Dev

Starts a development environment running the full stack of your MooseJS application locally. As you develop your MooseJS application locally, changes you make to your codebase will be automatically reflected here in real-time (when you save changes).

```txt filename="Terminal" copy
moose dev
```

### Clean

Clears all temporary data and stops development infrastructure.

```txt filename="Terminal" copy
moose clean
```

### Flow

Transforms upstream data into materialized datasets for analysis.

```txt filename="Terminal" copy
moose flow init --source <YourSourceDataModel> --destination <YourDestinationDataModel>
```
