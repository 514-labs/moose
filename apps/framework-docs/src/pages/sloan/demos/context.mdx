# Aircraft Metrics Definition

## Airspeed Metrics

**Ground Speed vs True Airspeed**: Ground speed (`gs`) represents the aircraft's speed relative to the ground, while true airspeed (`tas`) accounts for air density and temperature conditions. True airspeed calculation requires outside air temperature (`oat`) and pressure altitude data not currently available in our model.

**Indicated Airspeed (IAS)**: The airspeed reading from the aircraft's pitot-static system (`ias`), which differs from true airspeed based on altitude and atmospheric conditions. This metric requires direct airspeed sensor data not present in our current ADS-B feed.

## Climb/Descent Performance Metrics

**Vertical Speed**: Calculated using `baro_rate` (barometric rate) and `geom_rate` (geometric rate) to determine climb or descent performance. Positive values indicate climb, negative values indicate descent.

**Climb Efficiency**: Ratio of altitude gained to ground distance covered, calculated using altitude change (`alt_baro` or `alt_geom`) and position changes (`lat`, `lon`).

## Flight Phase Detection Metrics

**Takeoff Phase**: Identified by rapid altitude gain (`alt_baro` increasing) combined with increasing ground speed (`gs`) and high climb rate (`baro_rate` > 500 ft/min).

**Cruise Phase**: Characterized by stable altitude (minimal `baro_rate`), consistent ground speed (`gs`), and straight track (`track` changes < 5Â°).

**Approach Phase**: Detected by decreasing altitude (`baro_rate` < -300 ft/min), decreasing ground speed, and altitude below typical cruise levels.

**Landing Phase**: Final approach with very low altitude (`alt_baro` < 1000 ft), decreasing speed, and stable track toward runway.

## Signal Quality Metrics 

**Signal Strength**: Direct measurement using `rssi` (Received Signal Strength Indicator) to assess reception quality.

**Data Freshness**: Calculated using `seen` (seconds since last message) and `seen_pos` (seconds since last position update) to determine data reliability.

**Message Frequency**: Messages per minute calculated from `messages` count and time window to assess tracking consistency.

## Position Accuracy Metrics

**Navigation Accuracy**: Composite score using `nic` (Navigation Integrity Category), `nac_p` (Navigation Accuracy Category - Position), and `nac_v` (Navigation Accuracy Category - Velocity) to determine positional reliability.

**Surveillance Accuracy**: Assessment using `sil` (Surveillance Integrity Level) and `sda` (System Design Assurance) to evaluate overall tracking quality.

## Flight Efficiency Metrics 

**Great Circle Deviation**: Comparison of actual flight path (derived from sequential `lat`, `lon` coordinates) against the shortest great circle distance between origin and destination.

**Altitude Optimization**: Analysis of altitude profile against optimal flight levels for given aircraft type and distance.

**Speed Consistency**: Variance in ground speed (`gs`) throughout different flight phases to assess flight smoothness.

**Fuel Efficiency**: Calculated using fuel flow rate (`fuel_flow`) and ground speed to determine nautical miles per gallon. Requires engine performance data not available in our current dataset.

## Environmental & Weather Metrics 

**Wind Speed & Direction**: Calculated by comparing true airspeed (`tas`) with ground speed (`gs`) and track changes. Requires true airspeed data and wind vector information (`wind_speed`, `wind_direction`) not present in our model.

**Turbulence Detection**: Identified through rapid changes in altitude (`alt_baro`) and track (`track`) combined with accelerometer data (`vertical_g_force`, `lateral_g_force`) not available in ADS-B transmissions.

**Weather Avoidance**: Analysis of flight path deviations around weather systems using onboard weather radar data (`weather_radar_returns`) and precipitation intensity (`precip_intensity`) not included in our current data model.

## Traffic Density & Separation Metrics

**Aircraft Density**: Count of aircraft within defined geographical boundaries using `lat`, `lon` coordinates and configurable radius.

**Separation Metrics**: Minimum distances between aircraft calculated using position data and altitude differences.

**Airspace Utilization**: Percentage of available airspace occupied by tracked aircraft at different altitude bands.

## Operational Metrics

**Emergency Detection**: Identification of emergency situations using `emergency` codes, `squawk` codes (7500, 7600, 7700), and `alert` flags.

**Autopilot Usage**: Analysis of autopilot engagement using navigation modes (`nav_modes`) and flight path consistency.

**Communication Quality**: Assessment based on transponder performance, message consistency, and data completeness across all available fields.
