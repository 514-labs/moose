# Testing Streaming Functions

<Steps>
### Send Test Data to Source Data Model

Ingest test data into the source data model to trigger the function.

  Check out the [Ingesting Data](../ingest-data) section of the documentation.
</Callout>

### Check CLI Output

Check the terminal output to see if the streaming function has processed the data correctly. You should see the following message in your terminal:

```txt
Received SourceDataModel -> DestinationDataModel 1 message(s)
```

<Callout type="danger" title="Don't See This Message?">
  Here are some troubleshooting tips:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Make sure you have the correct source and destination data models in your
      function file.{" "}
    </li>
    <li>Save the function file after making changes. </li>
    <li>Double check your function logic for any errors. </li>
    <br />
    You can also run `moose logs --tail` to see logs in real-time.
  </ul>
</Callout>

### Inspect Destination Data Model Table

After the streaming function processes the data, check the destination table in the database to see if the data has been transformed correctly.
