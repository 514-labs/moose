# Initializing a Data Model

## Using the CLI

To create a new Data Model in your Moose application, use the `moose data-model init` command. This will generate a `.ts` or `.py` file in the `/datamodels` directory and define your Data Model within it.

For detailed information about the `moose data-model init` command, you can run the following in your terminal:

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
npx moose-cli data-model init --help

```

###### 💡 Helpful Hint:

    If you have sample data in a `.json` or `.csv` file, you can use the `--sample` flag to specify the path to that file. The CLI will then infer the Data Model schema from the provided file and create the Data Model for you.

## Creating a new Data Model Manually

There are two additional ways to initialize a new Data Model in your Moose project:

- By creating a new `.ts` or `.py` file in the `/datamodels` directory of your Moose application and defining a new interface or dataclass inside this file.
- By appending a new interface or dataclass to an existing `.ts` or `.py` file in your `/datamodels` directory
