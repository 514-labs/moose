MooseJS is an open-source developer framework for building data & analytics applications powered by a modern data stack. Moose takes the decades-old best practices of frontend and backend developer frameworks and brings them to your data & analytics stack.

# Alpha release
Moose is still in Alpha, and is not yet recommended for critical production use cases. That being said, we’d love for you to get your hands on it and try it out. Moose is in active development, and we’re looking for feedback and insights on how to harden and improve, as we build towards the Beta release.
