# Building a Data Service
MooseJS helps you build data intensive applications and service.

## What is a data service?
With the MooseJS's current functionality a data service can be thought of as a microservice that's used to capture, store and serve data. It interfaces with best in-class data infrastructure and allows you to build a data warehouse wihtout any data engineering skills. A service is composed of:

- A series of data models which define the structure of the data you want to caputre
- An ingestion API to capture data from other applications or services
- A storage layer that queues up data on ingestion and stores it for later processing

With the Moose toolchain, you get to use the same best practices you use for your application layer in your analytics and data warehousing layer.

**We'd recommend at least the following:**
- Using version control. We like managing our data services along side our main user applications in a mono-repo
- Using a CI/CD pipeline to deploy your service to production ensuring that tests are run before deployment

## What can data services be used for?
Data services can be used to capture data from your user applications and store it in a data warehouse. That means you can replace dedicated data capture tooling such as Segment or Mixpanel with your own data service and generic BI solution. This greatly reduces the cost of running your data infrastructure and gives you more control over your data.

Data services can be used for a variety of other use cases, including:

- Telemetry applications: Capture and analyze data from user interactions to gain insights and improve user experiences.
- Transaction statistics: Track and analyze transaction data to monitor performance, identify trends, and optimize processes.
- Dashboards: Build interactive dashboards to visualize and explore data in real-time.
- Ad hoc analytics: Perform on-demand analysis and generate custom reports for specific business needs.
- Machine learning: Use data services as a data source for training machine learning models and making predictions.
- Personalization: Leverage data services to deliver personalized experiences and recommendations to users.
