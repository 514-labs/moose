# Project Structure
MooseJS relies heavily on structural conventions to make sure you can build quickly and reliably. That means the project structure is important.


The following is the basic structure of a MooseJS project:
 
<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name=".moose"  />
  <FileTree.Folder name="app" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="datamodels" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.File name="models.prisma" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.Folder name="flows" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.File name="flows.ts" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.Folder name="insights" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.Folder name="metrics" />
      <FileTree.Folder name="charts" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
  <FileTree.File name="package.json" />
</FileTree>
