# Moose Architecture

<ZoomImg light="/architecture-light.svg" dark="/architecture-dark.svg" alt="Moose Architecture" />

## Infrastructure

Moose supports all the core infrastructure needed to power an analytical backend. Moose translates your native Typescript/Python/SQL into components in this underlying infrastructure.

| Infrastructure<br />Category | Supported<br />Software         | What You<br />Write                            | What Moose<br />Generates        |
|:-----------------------------|:--------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------|
| Realtime analytical database | Clickhouse                      | Data models as TS interfaces / Pydantic models | Tables                           |
|                              |                                 | SQL statements in TS/Py functions              | Views                            |
| Streaming engine             | Redpanda                        | Data models as TS interfaces / Pydantic models | Topics                           |
| Processing engine            | TS/Py (built into Moose binary) | TS/Py functions                                | Orchestrated streaming functions |
| Orchestration engine         | Temporal                        | TS/Py scripts                                  | Orchestrated workflows           |
| Webservers                   | Rust (built into Moose binary)  | Data models as TS interfaces / Pydantic models | Ingest APIs                      |
|                              |                                 | Parameterized SQL queries in TS/Py functions   | Egress APIs                      |

## Dev vs Production

When you run `moose dev`, Moose creates a local copy of your production analytical backend, and hot swaps in changes as you code.
This dev environment automatically includes containerized versions of each piece of core infrastructure.

When you want to deploy your Moose application into production, you'll need to provide and manage the underlying infrastructure, and point your Moose application at that production infra.
Alternatively, you can deploy your Moose application on managed infrastructure with one-click (including Bring Your Own Cloud/Infra) with Fiveonefour's [Boreal](https://www.fiveonefour.com/boreal) hosting service.

## Customizing Your Infrastructure

Moose is designed to be highly customizable. You can control which infrastructure is included in your deployment using `moose.config.toml`:

### Default Configuration
```toml filename="moose.config.toml"
[features]
streaming_engine = true  # Include Redpanda for streaming
workflows = true        # Enable Temporal for orchestration
```
<Callout type="warning">
By default, both `streaming_engine` and `workflows` are enabled. You must set the respective features to `false` to disable them.
</Callout>

### Disabling Streaming
```toml filename="moose.config.toml"
[features]
streaming_engine = false  # Disable Redpanda for streaming
```

### Disabling Orchestration
```toml filename="moose.config.toml"
[features]
workflows = false        # Disable Temporal for orchestration
```

## Development Environment Details

| Component | Purpose | Access |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| Web Server | Handles HTTP requests for data ingestion and APIs | localhost:4000 |
| ClickHouse | Analytical database for data storage and querying | localhost:18123 |
| Redpanda | Kafka-compatible message broker for streaming | localhost:19092 |
| Temporal | Workflow orchestration engine | localhost:7233 (Server) / localhost:8080 (UI) |
| Redis | Caching and temporary storage | Internal only |

All these components are automatically configured to work together, creating a complete development environment that mirrors a production deployment.
