### Why is Docker is not working after making changes to some fields?

Terminate the Docker containers and restart Docker manually. If you have problems restarting run `npm run dev` twice.

### Why has a test run crashed?

Making changes to the data model while a test run is going will cause it to crash because of the real time updates.
