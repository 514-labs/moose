# Materialized Views

## Create materialized views to pre-aggregate your data, based on your egress API

This demo will walk you through using Sloan tools to prompt your way to creating materialized views that pre-aggregate the aircraft telemetry data you've ingested.

[Skip to prompt](#prompt-the-llm-to-create-a-materialized-view) if you started with the ads-b template.

<Callout type="info" title="Prerequisites">
- **Sloan and Moose CLIs**: [Install them here](/sloan/getting-started/cursor)
- **OS**: macOS or Linux (WSL supported for Windows)
- **Docker Desktop/Engine**: [24.0.0+](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)
- **Node**: [version 20+](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (LTS recommended)
- **Anthropic API Key**: [Get one here](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/initial-setup)
- **Client**: [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) 
- **Completed**: [Ingest Demo](/sloan/demos/ingest) (or have data already in your system)
</Callout>

<Steps>

### Start with the ads-b template

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
sloan init mvs-demo ads-b
```

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
cd mvs-demo
npm install
```

### Run the Moose Dev Server

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
moose dev 
```

### Open the project in Cursor

### Initialize the Sloan MCP

Navigate to `Cursor > Settings > Cursor Settings > Tools and Integrations` then toggle on the `Sloan MCP` tool.

### For best results, set the LLM to `claude-4-sonnet`

Gemini 2.5 and o3 are also reasonably good, but claude-4-sonnet has the most consistent results.

### Create an egress API

You can skip this step if you've already completed the [Egress Demo](/sloan/demos/egress).

If you prefer to implement the egress API manually, you can create the following analytics API:

```typescript filename="app/index.ts"
...
export * from './apis/getAircraftWithinRadius';

```


```typescript filename="app/apis/getAircraftWithinRadius.ts"
import { Api } from "@514labs/moose-lib";
import { tags } from "typia";

/**
 * Parameters for the getAircraftWithinRadius API
 */
interface AircraftRadiusParams {
  /** Latitude of the center point */
  center_lat: number;
  
  /** Longitude of the center point */
  center_lon: number;
  
  /** Radius in miles from the center point */
  radius_miles: number;
  
  /** Maximum number of results to return (optional) */
  limit?: number & tags.Type<"int64"> & tags.Minimum<1> & tags.Maximum<1000>;
}

/**
 * API to retrieve aircraft within a specified radius from given coordinates
 * Uses ClickHouse's geoDistance function to calculate great circle distance
 */
export const getAircraftWithinRadius = new Api<AircraftRadiusParams>(
  "getAircraftWithinRadius",
  async (params, { client, sql }) => {
    // Execute the query with proper parameter handling
    const result = await client.query.execute(sql`
      SELECT 
        hex,
        flight,
        aircraft_type,
        lat,
        lon,
        alt_baro,
        gs,
        track,
        timestamp,
        round(geoDistance(lon, lat, ${params.center_lon}, ${params.center_lat}) * 0.000621371, 2) as distance_miles
      FROM AircraftTrackingProcessed 
      WHERE geoDistance(lon, lat, ${params.center_lon}, ${params.center_lat}) * 0.000621371 <= ${params.radius_miles}
      ORDER BY distance_miles ASC
      LIMIT ${params.limit || 100}
    `);
    
    return result;
  },
  {
    metadata: {
      description: "Returns all aircraft within a specified distance (in miles) from given coordinates"
    }
  }
);
```

</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

### Prompt the LLM to create a materialized view

> Given the egress API, can you create a materialized view that improves the performance of the query?

### Action

The LLM should now use sloan tools to:
1. analyze the Moose project and the egress API
2. create a Materialized View that pre-aggregates the data

You'll know it is succeeding if:
1. the LLM successfully creates the materialized view
2. the LLM sees that the materialized view was created in the ClickHouse database

### Optional further prompts

> Can you create a new egress API that leverages the materialized view to improve the performance of the query?

> Can you test both APIs to see what the performance difference is?
> I want to see the difference in speed, number of rows read, amount of data read, compute, and other vectors you think are pertinent.
