# Blocks Functionality Deprecation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to deprecate the blocks functionality in the framework while maintaining backward compatibility for existing projects.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. TypeScript Library (`packages/ts-moose-lib/`)

#### Modified Files:
- **`src/blocks/runner.ts`**: 
  - Replaced the `runBlocks` function to show deprecation warnings instead of executing blocks
  - Removed unused imports and helper functions
  - Added logic to detect and warn about existing blocks files
  
- **`src/blocks/helpers.ts`**:
  - Added console warnings when the blocks helpers are imported
  - Kept all interface definitions and helper functions for backward compatibility

#### Changes Made:
- When blocks are found, displays warning messages about deprecation
- No actual execution of blocks SQL queries
- Maintains all exports for backward compatibility

### 2. Python Library (`packages/py-moose-lib/`)

#### Modified Files:
- **`moose_lib/blocks.py`**:
  - Added deprecation warnings using Python's `warnings` module
  - Kept all class definitions and helper functions for backward compatibility

- **`apps/framework-cli/src/framework/python/wrappers/blocks_runner.py`**:
  - Replaced the main execution logic with deprecation warnings
  - Removed unused imports and helper functions
  - Added logic to detect and warn about existing blocks files

#### Changes Made:
- When blocks are found, displays warning messages about deprecation
- No actual execution of blocks SQL queries
- Maintains all exports for backward compatibility

### 3. Framework CLI (`apps/framework-cli/`)

#### Modified Files:
- **`src/project.rs`**:
  - Updated `blocks_dir()` method to NOT create new blocks directories
  - Added deprecation warnings when existing blocks directories are found
  - Maintained the method for backward compatibility

- **`src/infrastructure/processes/blocks_registry.rs`**:
  - Added deprecation warnings in the `start()` method
  - Maintained the process creation for backward compatibility

- **`src/framework/python/templates.rs`**:
  - Added deprecation comments to blocks templates
  - Kept templates for backward compatibility but marked them as deprecated

- **`src/framework/typescript/templates.rs`**:
  - Added deprecation comments to blocks templates
  - Kept templates for backward compatibility but marked them as deprecated

## Backward Compatibility Features

### For Existing Projects:
1. **No Breaking Changes**: All existing code continues to compile and run
2. **Deprecation Warnings**: Clear warnings are shown when blocks are detected
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Blocks are ignored rather than causing errors
4. **API Preservation**: All blocks-related imports and exports remain available

### For New Projects:
1. **No Blocks Directory Creation**: New projects won't get a blocks directory
2. **No Blocks Templates**: Template files won't be created for blocks
3. **Clean Project Structure**: New projects start without deprecated functionality

## Warning Messages

All deprecation warnings follow this format:
```
⚠️  DEPRECATION WARNING: Blocks functionality has been deprecated and is no longer supported.
⚠️  Found X blocks files in [directory], but they will be ignored.
⚠️  Please migrate to the new data processing features. See documentation for alternatives.
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Existing Projects**: Test that projects with existing blocks continue to work without errors
2. **New Projects**: Verify that new projects don't create blocks directories
3. **Import Tests**: Ensure that importing blocks-related modules shows deprecation warnings
4. **CLI Tests**: Test that the CLI shows appropriate warnings when blocks are present

## Migration Path

For users migrating away from blocks:
1. Review existing blocks SQL queries
2. Migrate to new data processing features (as per documentation)
3. Remove blocks directories and files when ready
4. Update imports to remove blocks-related functionality

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Non-Breaking**: Existing projects continue to work
2. **Clear Communication**: Users are informed about deprecation
3. **Gradual Migration**: Users can migrate at their own pace
4. **Clean New Projects**: New projects start with modern architecture
5. **Maintainable**: Deprecated code is clearly marked and can be removed in future versions
