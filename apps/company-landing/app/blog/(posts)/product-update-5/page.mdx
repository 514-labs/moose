#### What is the Metrics Console? 📊

Have you ever wondered why something is not working in your Moose application and did not know where to look or you want to know how your Moose app is performing? Or perhaps you are just curious about some metrics?

The Metrics Console is the answer because it surfaces a wide range of metrics to monitor your app’s performance in real-time. This makes it easier for you to pinpoint the root cause of issues in your application. The Metrics Console allows you to do all of this in your terminal.

To launch the Metrics Console you can run the command:
`moose metrics`

#### What Metrics Can You View? 🔍

**In the Metrics Console, you can view three main categories of metrics.**

- **Endpoint Metrics:** These metrics track the performance of your ingest and consumption endpoints.
  - **Overview Metrics:** These metrics include the number of requests per second, bytes per second in and out, the average latency, and the total number of requests.
  - **Detailed Metrics:** You can select a specific endpoint to open a detailed view displaying more granular metrics and charts for that endpoint. These metrics include: total requests, requests per second, bytes per second in/out, and average latency.
- **Kafka to Clickhouse Sync Metrics:**
  This is the process that takes the ingested data through Kafka and stores it into Clickhouse.
  You can view how many Kafka messages are being sent from each endpoint and how many are received from each Clickhouse table.
  There are also metrics tracking the lag, messages per second, and bytes per second.
- **Streaming Functions Metrics:**
  These metrics help you monitor the number of Kafka messages transferred in and out of your Streaming Functions (aka the number of data samples in and database table rows returned).
  For each Streaming Funciton in your app, you can also monitor the number of messages in/out per second and the bytes out per second.

#### How Can You View Raw Metrics?

When your development server is running (start it via the `moose dev` command), you can see the metrics that your Moose app is collecting by visiting `localhost:4000/metrics`. All of the metrics outputted to this endpoint are in Prometheus format.

Here is an example of one of the metrics that is sent to this HTTP endpoint

```
# HELP kafka_clickhouse_sync_bytes_out Bytes sent to clickhouse.
# TYPE kafka_clickhouse_sync_bytes_out counter
kafka_clickhouse_sync_bytes_out_total{consumer_group="clickhouse sync",topic="UserActivity_0_0"} 100
kafka_clickhouse_sync_bytes_out_total{consumer_group="clickhouse sync",topic="ParsedActivity_0_0"} 150
# HELP streaming_functions_bytes Bytes sent from one data model to another using kafka stream.
# TYPE streaming_functions_bytes gauge
streaming_functions_bytes{path="UserActivity_0_0 -> ParsedActivity_0_0"} 150
# EOF
```

If your Moose app is in production on your own infrastructure, you can see the metrics by visiting the metrics HTTP endpoint at `<YOUR_MOOSE_URL>/metrics`.

#### Technical Bits On The Metrics Console's Performance

**The Metrics Console was developed with speed and efficiency in mind.**
The Metrics Console is built as a completely separate process from the rest of the Moose CLI.
When running, this process collects and sends Prometheus metrics to the `/metrics` HTTP endpoint of your Moose app every second.
These metrics are then parsed, stored, and displayed right in your terminal interface.
Even though we are sending metrics every second, you will not notice any performance degradation in your Moose app.

**That's right Moose is still extremely fast!**
