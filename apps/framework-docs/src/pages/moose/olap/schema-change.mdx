# Breaking In-Place Schema Changes


## Incompatible Data Type Changes

If you have a table with data in it, and want to change the type of that column, but the type change fails....

- You get into an error state where the table is in a broken state.

Impact:

- You cannot just go into your data model code and "undo" the type change, because theres a stuck mutation
- So you have to manually kill the mutation first before you can make any other changes

... here theres an opportunity to automatically kill the mutation for the user...

- We need to clearly show the user we killed the mutation. But then the bigger problem is you still cannot query the table.

...so we need to tell them to "undo" the type change

Proposed solution:
Instruct the user to go to their table definition and change back the type of 'column: column name" back to the original type -> which we should show in the message.

we do not want to magically revert their code for them, we want to make the user be explicit about what to do here.

^^^^ THIS UNFUCKS THE MUTATATION FAILURE ^^^^^

then we probably need to help them achieve their desired state which is a "type chage":

Do we instruct them to:

- Create a new column named old_name_v2
- And then backfill?
