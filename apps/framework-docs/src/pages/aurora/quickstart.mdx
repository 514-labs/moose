# Aurora MCP Quickstart

Aurora exposes tools to your LLM client for reading, exploring, and building on Clickhouse data—locally or in production. Go from remote Clickhouse to natural language queries, metadata, and egress APIs in minutes. These quickstarts will show you how to get started with ad-hoc analytics on your Clickhouse project, create your own local dev environment that you can build on with Aurora MCP tools, and deploy a full analytics backend from a template.
