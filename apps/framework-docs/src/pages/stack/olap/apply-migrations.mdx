## Overview

Moose dynamically works to keep your database schema in sync with your code. As long as:
- You start the Moose runtime
- All `OlapTable` and `MaterializedView` instances are exported from the root <TypeScript inline>index.ts</TypeScript> <Python inline>main.py</Python> file

Moose will automatically apply the changes to your database.

## Development Workflow

When in local development, you can use the `moose dev` command to start the Moose runtime.

All changes to your code will be automatically applied to your locally running database, not your production database.

## Production Workflow
When you deploy your code to production, Moose will compare your code with your production database schema, and apply the changes to your production database during the deployment process.
