# Tracking Custom Events

To start instrumenting your own custom events, follow these two key steps:

1. **Create a Data Model:** Define a new Data Model containing the properties you want to represent in your custom event.
2. **Instrument Your Application:** Implement tracking in your existing application to send the custom event data to the Moose ingestion infrastructure you just set up.

## Define a New Data Model

For client-side events, we recommend beginning with the global properties found in the [`PageViewRaw` model](). From there, you can then add custom properties relevant to the specific events you want to track.

### Example: Button Click Event

If you want to track button click events, you could create a `ButtonClickEvent` Data Model with the following additional properties:

- `cta_copy` (the text on the button clicked)
- `cta_target` (the target link redirected by the button).

Add this `ButtonClickEvent` Data Model to your `models.ts` file:

```ts filename="moose/app/datamodels/models.ts" copy
export interface ButtonClickEvent extends PageViewRaw {
    cta_copy   String // Text on the button clicked
    cta_target String // Target link redirected by the button
}

```

<Callout>
  The `extends PageViewRaw` approach ensures you capture both the context (via
  common web analytics data fields) and the specific user interaction details
  for the event.
</Callout>

### Save Your Changes

Moose will configure the same infrastructure components you already have for the `PageViewRaw`, but this time these components are typed to the schema for the new `ButtonClickEvent` model.

Validate that Moose configured all the infrastructure for you by opening a new terminal window and running the following command:

```bash filename="terminal" copy
npx moose-cli ls
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Make sure you are in the `moose` project directory and your dev server is
  running (`moose dev`)
</Callout>

## Sending Custom Events

  If your custom event is being instrumented from the client side of your web app, you can leverage the `script.js` that is already integrated into your application.

#### Example: Tracking Button Click Events

Add the following code to the `onClick()` event handler for the button you want to track:

```tsx filename="Your Web App Client Code" copy
window.MooseAnalytics.trackEvent("ButtonClickEvent", {
  cta_copy: button_text, // Dynamically capture the button text
  cta_target: target_href, // Capture the target URL
});
```

### Key Points

- The first argument to `trackEvent()` corresponds to the data model name, ensuring the right model is used for transmitting your data to Moose.
- The second argument is an object that includes the properties unique to the `ButtonClickEvent`, as specified in your data model.
- The integrated script enriches the event data with common web analytics properties defined in the `PageViewRaw` model. This means you do not need to manually set these properties, as they are automatically appended to your event data payload in the tracking script.

    If your custom event is being instrumented from the server side of your application, you can use the generated SDK to send the custom event data to Moose.
    
    See the [SDK documentation](/building/ingest-data/ingest-sdk) for more information on how to use the SDK to send data.
