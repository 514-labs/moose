# Reliability Features

## Overview
Enterprise-grade reliability features powered by Temporal, providing robust workflow execution with built-in monitoring, error handling, and recovery capabilities.

## Core Features

### Idempotency
- Automatic deduplication of workflow runs
- Checkpointing of DataFrame operations
- State management through Temporal
- Consistent execution guarantees

### Restartability
- Resume from any step after failures
- Maintain state and data lineage
- Partial retries for failed steps
- Checkpoint restoration

### Monitoring
- Step-level metrics
- DataFrame operation statistics
- Memory and CPU usage tracking
- Duration monitoring
- Comprehensive error reporting

## Error Handling

### Step Failures
- Automatic retry with configurable backoff
- Maintain partial results
- Optional step skipping
- Detailed error reporting
- Custom error handlers

### Data Validation
- Schema validation between steps
- DataFrame integrity checks
- Type compatibility verification
- Size and resource limits
- Data quality assertions

## Temporal Integration
- Workflow state management
- Activity execution tracking
- Parallel execution handling
- Configuration mapping
- Built-in reliability patterns

## Monitoring Features

### Metrics
```toml
# Monitoring configuration
[monitoring]
metrics_endpoint = "prometheus"
trace_sampling = 0.1
log_level = "info"

[alerts]
on_failure = ["slack", "email"]
on_duration_threshold = "1h"
```

### Observability
- Real-time workflow status
- Historical execution data
- Performance analytics
- Resource utilization tracking
- Error rate monitoring

### Alerting
- Configurable alert channels
- Failure notifications
- Duration thresholds
- Resource usage alerts
- Custom alert conditions
