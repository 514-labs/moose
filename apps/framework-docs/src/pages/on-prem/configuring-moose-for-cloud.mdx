# Configuring Moose for cloud environments

In the [Packaging Moose for deployment](packaging-moose-for-deployment.mdx) page we looked at how to package your moose application into docker containers (using the `moose build --docker` command) and you've pushed them to your container repository.

We're now ready to connect and configure your container image for use with remote Clickhouse and Redpanda hosted services.

The methods used to accomplish this are generaly similar but the specific details depend on your target cloud infrastructure. So, we'll look at the overarching concepts and provide a couple of common examples.

## Specifying your repository container

Earlier we created two local containers and pushed those to a docker repository.

```txt filename="Terminal" copy
>docker images
REPOSITORY                                              TAG               IMAGE ID       CREATED              SIZE
moose-df-deployment-aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu           0.3.136           c50674c7a68a   About a minute ago   155MB
moose-df-deployment-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu            0.3.136           e5b449d3dea3   About a minute ago   163MB
```

We pushed the containers to the `514labs` Docker Hub account. So we have these two containers available for use:

```
514labs/moose-df-deployment-aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu:0.3.136
514labs/moose-df-deployment-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu:0.3.136
```

In the following examples we'll use an AMD64 (x86_64) based machine so I'll stick to use the following container image: `514labs/moose-df-deployment-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu:0.3.136`

In the following examples we'll look at how the container image name can be used in a varity of cloud providers and scenios.

## General overview

The general approach is to use a cloud provider that supports specifying a container image to launch your application. Examples, include the Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) and Amazon's Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) and Elastic Container Service (ECS). Each provider also offers a way of configuring container environment variables that your container application will have access to. We'll look at which environment variables need to be configured later in this document.
