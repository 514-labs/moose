//! # Infrastructure Map Module
//!
//! This module is a cornerstone of the Moose framework, providing a comprehensive representation
//! of all infrastructure components and their relationships. It serves as the source of truth for
//! the entire system architecture and enables infrastructure-as-code capabilities.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The `InfrastructureMap` tracks all components of the system:
//! - Data storage components (tables, views)
//! - Streaming components (topics)
//! - API components (endpoints)
//! - Process components (synchronization processes, function processes, etc.)
//!
//! This map enables the framework to:
//! 1. Generate a complete representation of the required infrastructure
//! 2. Compare infrastructure states to determine necessary changes
//! 3. Apply changes to actual infrastructure components
//! 4. Persist infrastructure state for later reference
//!
//! ## Key Components
//!
//! - `InfrastructureMap`: The main struct containing all infrastructure components
//! - `InfraChanges`: Represents changes between two infrastructure states
//! - Change enums: Various enums representing specific types of changes to components
//!
//! ## Usage Flow
//!
//! 1. Generate an `InfrastructureMap` from primitive components
//! 2. Compare maps to determine changes using `diff()`
//! 3. Apply changes to actual infrastructure
//! 4. Store the updated map for future reference
//!
//! This module is essential for maintaining consistency between the defined infrastructure
//! and the actual deployed components.
