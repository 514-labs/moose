# Configure Github Webhook

Now let’s get some real data into this data infrastructure. We’ll do this by configuring Github’s webhook service to send event data to the `/ingest/RawStarEvent` API.

<Callout type="warning">
  Since your Moose development server is running locally, you’ll need to use
  Pinggy or NGROK to expose the port its running on to the web. This allows for
  external webhook notifications from GitHub to be proxied to your local dev
  server.
</Callout>

## Get a Port Forwarding URL to [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

To connect you local Moose instance over the internet, you need a port forwarding service that connects your local port to a public URL.

<Tabs items={['Using Pinggy', 'Using Ngrok']}>

<Tabs.Tab>
### Setting Up Pinggy  
Run this command in your terminal:
```bash
ssh -p 443 -R0:localhost:4000 -L4300:localhost:4300 qr@a.pinggy.io
```
You should see a few messages printed to your terminal, followed by this prompt: 
```txt
The authenticity of host '[a.pinggy.io]:443...
...
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?
```
- Type `yes` to add Pinggy to your known SSH hosts.
    
You should see the below message printed to your terminal output: 
    
```text
                           You are not authenticated.
Your tunnel will expire in 60 minutes. Upgrade to Pinggy Pro to get unrestricted
                      tunnels. https://dashboard.pinggy.io

http://<YOUR_PINGGY_GENERATED_LINK>.a.free.pinggy.link
https://<YOUR_PINGGY_GENERATED_LINK>.a.free.pinggy.link

**Copy the `https` URL. This is your forwarding URL.** You’ll need this to set up the Github webhook in the next step.

#### Using Ngrok

<Callout type="warning" title="Don't have Ngrok Installed?">
Follow the Ngrok onboarding steps. Otherwise, we recommend following the [Using Pinggy]() guide to avoid the need to register.
</Callout>

If you’ve got `ngrok` already installed run `ngrok http 4000.`

<Callout type="warning" title="Save Your Forwarding URL">
It will come in handy later in the tutorial
</Callout>

## Configure Github Webhook

Now you’ll configure GitHub to send webhook notifications to your Pinggy forwarding URL when someone stars your repository.

<Steps>
#### Login to your [Github.com](http://github.com/) account.

#### Select a Repository to Track
Navigate to this repository to set up webhook notifications.

    <Callout type="warning">
    You must own this repository!
    </Callout>

#### Open Settings > Webhooks in your Repository
- Locate the '**Webhooks**' settings in the sidebar navigation
- On the Webhooks page, click the **Add Webhook** button.


#### Configure Webhook Settings
    - In the **Payload URL** field, paste in your **forwarding URL** you previously copied to your clipboard. **Append: `/ingest/RawStarEvent`**
    - Set **Content type** to `application/json`.
    - **Secret**: Leave empty.


    - Under **"Which events would you like to trigger this webhook?"**, choose **"Let me select individual events"**.
        - Scroll through the events to configure notifications:
            - **Unselect "Pushes"**
            - **Select "Stars"**

        ![](/webhook-config-settings.gif)

#### Save Your Settings
Click **"Add Webhook"** to save your configuration.
    - The new webhook will appear in the list. It won't have a green checkmark until it sends its first notification.
</Steps>

## Trigger the Webhook: Get the Live Data Flowing!

<Steps>
### Star & Un-star your Github Repository
Go to your Github repository and star/un-star it.
<Callout type="info">
Send us your URL, we’ll do it too.
</Callout>
### Check for `POST` and `SUCCESS` messages in CLI
Check back on your terminal window. You should see `POST` and `SUCCESS` messages printed to the CLI:

    <Callout type="success">
    You now have live, real-time Github event data landing in your Moose app!
    </Callout>

### Re-run `RawStarEvent` Query in DB Explorer
Go back to your database explorer and re-run this same query on the `RawStarEvent` table from earlier:

    ```sql filename="Your DB Explorer" copy
    SELECT * FROM local.RawStarEvent_0_0
    ```

    You should see the your own Github username and up-to-date information about your repositories!

</Steps>


<Callout type="success" title="Celebrate your Progress!">
You've defined a Data Model, configured a GitHub webhook, and ingested real-time GitHub event data into your Moose application.
<br/><br/>
Your full data stack is up and running—a webserver, streaming data platform, and OLAP database—with live data flowing in. **You achieved all of that with just a few lines of code!**
