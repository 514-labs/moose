# Building and Deploying Moose Applications
<LanguageSwitcher />

This guide will walk you through the process of building a Moose application and deploying it to a server that does not have internet access. 
We'll cover both the build environment setup and the deployment environment requirements.

## Build Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

Before you can build a Moose application, you need to set up your build environment with the following dependencies:

OS:
- Debian 10+
- Ubuntu 18.10+
- Fedora 29+
- CentOS/RHEL 8+
- Amazon Linux 2023+
- Mac OS 13+

Common CLI utilities:
- zip
- curl (optional, for installing the Moose CLI)

<TypeScript>

Typescript build environment requirements:
1. Node.js 20 or later
2. npm, yarn or pnpm package manager
3. Moose CLI
</TypeScript>

<Python>

Python build environment requirements:
1. Python 3.12 or later (we recommend using pyenv for Python version management)
2. pip 
</Python>

### Setting up the Build Environment

<TypeScript>
First, ensure you have Node.js installed. We recommend using nvm (Node Version Manager):

```bash
# Install nvm
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash

# Reload shell configuration
source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc

# Install and use Node.js 20
nvm install 20
nvm use 20
```

Verify the installation:
```bash
node --version
npm --version  # or yarn --version
```
</TypeScript>

<Python>
First, install the required system dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev \
  libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev curl git libncursesw5-dev xz-utils \
  tk-dev libxml2-dev libxmlsec1-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev
```

Install pyenv and configure your shell:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://pyenv.run | bash
```

Add the following to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"
command -v pyenv >/dev/null || export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
```

Install and set Python 3.12:

```bash
pyenv install 3.12
pyenv global 3.12
```

Verify the installation:
```bash
python --version
```
</Python>

### Installing Moose CLI (Optional)

You can install the Moose CLI using the official installer:

```bash
curl -SfsL https://fiveonefour.com/install.sh | bash -s -- moose
source ~/.bashrc  # Or restart your terminal
```
or

<Python>
```bash
pip install moose-cli
```
</Python>

<TypeScript>
```bash
npm install -g @514labs/moose-cli
```
</TypeScript>

## Building Your Application

### 1. Initialize a New Project (Optional)
This step is optional if you already have a Moose project.
Create a new Moose project:

<TypeScript>
```bash
moose init your-project-name ts
cd your-project-name
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install  # or yarn install
```
</TypeScript>

<Python>
```bash
moose init your-project-name py
cd your-project-name
```
</Python>

### 2. Build the Application

<Callout type="info">
  Make sure you have the `zip` utility installed (`sudo apt install zip`) before building your application.
</Callout>

if you installed the moose cli to be available globally, you can build the application with the following command:
```bash
moose build
```
Or if you installed the moose cli to be available locally, you can build the application with the following command:

<TypeScript>
Create the deployable package:
```bash
npm run moose-cli build
```
</TypeScript>

<Python>
The build process will create a deployable package:

```bash
moose build
```
</Python>

This will create a zip file in your project directory with a timestamp, for example: `your-project-name-YYYY-MM-DD.zip`

## Deployment Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

The deployment server requires:

<TypeScript>
1. Node.js 20 or later
3. Unzip utility
</TypeScript>

<Python>
1. Python 3.12 or later
3. Unzip utility
</Python>

### Setting up the Deployment Environment

1. Install the runtime environment:

<TypeScript>
Follow the Node.js installation steps from the build environment setup section.
</TypeScript>

<Python>
Follow the Python installation steps from the build environment setup section.
</Python>

2. Install the unzip utility:
```bash
sudo apt install unzip
```

## Deploying Your Application

1. Copy your built application package to the deployment server

2. Extract the application:
```bash
unzip your-project-name-YYYY-MM-DD.zip -d ./app
cd ./app/packager
```

3. Start your application:

<TypeScript>
```bash
# If using npm scripts
npm run moose-cli prod

# Or directly with moose
moose prod
```
</TypeScript>

<Python>
```bash
moose prod
```
</Python>

<Callout type="warning">
  Ensure all required environment variables and configurations are properly set before starting your application.
</Callout>

## Troubleshooting

<TypeScript>
- Verify that Node.js is properly installed using `node --version`
- Check that your application's dependencies are properly listed in `package.json`
- If you encounter TypeScript compilation errors, ensure your `tsconfig.json` is properly configured
</TypeScript>

<Python>
- Verify that Python is properly installed using `python --version`
- Check that your application's dependencies are properly listed in `requirements.txt`
- If you encounter Python import errors, ensure your `PYTHONPATH` is properly set
</Python>
