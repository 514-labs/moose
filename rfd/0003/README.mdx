This will not cover:

- Authentication
- Governance

We will cover those in a different RFD.

## Context

As it was raised by @mcginleyr1 in the [RFD 0001 - Ecosystem Skeleton Architecture](https://github.com/514-labs/igloo-stack/pull/59), we need a good and easy pattern for data extraction from third party systems to be made available through the Igloo toolkit.

There are different types of systems the data needs to be extracted from:

- Databases
- APIs

Some systems generate data:

- Applications
- IoT devices
