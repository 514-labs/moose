# Introduction

Aggregations allow you to derive new datasets from existing database tables by slicing, summarizing, combining, filtering, and grouping data. These database-level transformations are defined using SQL `SELECT` queries, which contain your desired data transformation logic. Moose automatically creates a materialized view in your database using the provided query, which is continuously updated as new data is added to your source table(s).

## Why Use Aggregations

Aggregations are ideal for:

- Pre-computing results for frequently used queries.
- Performing database-level transformations that should be consistently triggered as new data is ingested.
- Ensuring high-performance querying and analysis by keeping transformed data readily available.
- Creating reusable data subsets that can be utilized by other parts of your application, including other Aggregations and Consumption APIs.

## Aggregation Lifecycle

1. **Define**: Write a SQL `SELECT` query that defines your desired data transformation.
2. **Save**: Save your query in the `/aggregations` folder of your project.
3. **Execute**: Moose executes your query to create a materialized view in your database.
4. **Update**: The materialized view is continuously updated as new data is added to your source table(s).
