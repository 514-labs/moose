# Model Data
MooseJS's data modeling is built on top of Prisma's intuitive schema modeling language. You can read more about Prisma's schema modeling language [here](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema). To get started you simply need to create a `.prisma` file in your project's data model directory. If you're in development mode, MooseJS will automatically detect this file and use it to generate:
- A typed data capture SDK to instument your application
- A high performance ingestion server to receive data from your application
- A buffer to store data as it's ingested from the webserver
- A ingestion table and an analtics view to store and query your data

## Creating a Model
```prisma filename="datamodels/user.prisma" copy
model User {
    name        String
    description String
}
```

As you can see, the model is very simple. It's just a list of fields and their types. MooseJS will automatically generate a table for you in your database and a view to query your data. We don't currently support all of Prisma's schema modeling features, but we're working on it. If you'd like to see a feature added, please join our [Slack community](https://join.slack.com/t/igloocommunity/shared_invite/zt-25gsnx2x2-9ttVTt4L9LYFrRcM6jimcg) and let us know.

## Next steps
Now that you've created a model, you can start instrumenting your application. To do that, you'll need to link the MooseJS SDK to your project we cover the process in the [next section](/building/capture-data). If you're interested in knowing what happens when you change your data model, simply head to the make changes section of the docs.
