# Configuring Moose for cloud environments

In the [Packaging Moose for deployment](packaging-moose-for-deployment.mdx) page, we looked at how to package your moose application into Docker containers (using the `moose build â€”-docker` command), and you've pushed them to your container repository.

We can connect and configure your container image with remote Clickhouse and Redpanda-hosted services.

The methods used to accomplish this are generally similar, but the specific details depend on your target cloud infrastructure. So, we'll look at the overarching concepts and provide some common examples.

## Specifying your repository container

Earlier, we created two local containers and pushed them to a docker repository.

```txt filename="Terminal" copy
>docker images
REPOSITORY                                              TAG               IMAGE ID       CREATED              SIZE
moose-df-deployment-aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu           0.3.175           c50674c7a68a   About a minute ago   155MB
moose-df-deployment-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu            0.3.175           e5b449d3dea3   About a minute ago   163MB
```

We pushed the containers to the `514labs` Docker Hub account. So, we have these two containers available for use:

```
514labs/moose-df-deployment-aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu:0.3.175
514labs/moose-df-deployment-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu:0.3.175
```

In the following examples, we'll use an AMD64 (x86_64) based machine, so I'll stick to using the following container image: `514labs/moose-df-deployment-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu:0.3.136`

In the following examples, we'll examine how the container image name can be used in various cloud providers and scenarios.

## General overview

The general approach is to use a cloud provider that supports specifying a container image to launch your application. Examples include the Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Amazon's Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), and Elastic Container Service (ECS). Each provider also offers a way of configuring container environment variables that your container application will have access to. We'll look at which environment variables must be configured later in this document.
