# Planning
<LanguageSwitcher />

## Overview

The Planning capability provides standalone architecture design and infrastructure planning for MooseStack applications. You can use this capability independently to design data architectures and plan infrastructure without requiring all MooseStack components to be implemented.

## Standalone Usage

The Planning capability is designed to work independently. You can use it without requiring any other MooseStack components:

  bullets={[
    {
      title: "No implementation required",
      description: "Plan your architecture before implementing any MooseStack capabilities"
    },
    {
      title: "Capability evaluation",
      description: "Assess which capabilities you need based on your requirements"
    },
    {

    },
    {
      title: "Risk assessment",
      description: "Evaluate risks and plan mitigation strategies for your architecture"
    }
  ]}
/>

## Integration with Other Capabilities

The Planning capability provides the foundation for implementing all other MooseStack capabilities:

- **OLAP Database**: Plan database schemas, tables, and materialized views
- **APIs**: Design API architectures and integration patterns
- **Streaming**: Plan real-time data flows and event processing
- **Workflows**: Design ETL pipelines and task orchestration
- **Runtime**: Plan deployment strategies and infrastructure requirements
