Some high-level concepts core to Change Data Management

## Versions

In the Moose Change Data Management model, code in the last commit of your `main`
branch is the current, latest version. It is accordingly tagged as such in the version
property in the `package.json` file in your Moose application's top-level folder.

Previous versions are tagged in the `project.toml` file, `[supported_old_versions]`
section. We decided to not use Git tags for workflow reasons and to let users leverage
tags however they want. If you would rather manage versions through tags instead of a
file committed in the repository, [please let us know](https://join.slack.com/t/moose-community/shared_invite/zt-2fjh5n3wz-cnOmM9Xe9DYAgQrNu8xKxg).

When a data model is part of a version, the table, ingestion endpoint, and topic are
all named with that version. This duplicates some infrastructure such that all
the data for each version is consistent and replayable.

We also maintain an alias to the latest version of tables and ingestion endpoints
so that you can always send data to the latest version, if you so choose — the alias
being the name of the table unmodified by version.

## Continuous Migrations

We want to enable you to move forward with your versions and changes without breaking
upstream or downstream processes. We also want you to have the latest data available.
We also want to incentivize your data consumers to move to the latest version of the
data model.

As such we continuously process data that lands in old versions to land in the latest
version of the data. We do not, however, go back in time: data that lands in old
versions of the data model will be populated in new Data Models, but data that lands
in new Data Models will not be sent to old Data Models.

This is a continuous process that runs directly in the database. It is near real-time
so you will get the freshest data in your latest version of the data model at all times.

This migration is defined in a SQL mapping file, which Moose populates with the expected
migration, and can be changed by the user if specific migration mappings, typing, or
other parameters need to be defined.

## Initial Data Migrations

When a new version of the table is first created, it needs to be filled with data
from the previous version. The initial data migration is the initial provisioning of data.
When that happens, behind the scenes, the associated infrastructure is paused to ensure
that no data gets duplicated accidentally between your versions of the tables.

Once the initial data load is complete in the new table, that infrastructure is unpaused
and the data flows.
